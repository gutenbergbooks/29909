<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">From</span> Padstow Point to Lundy Race is one of
the wildest and grandest portions of the
Cornish coast, and on it there is always somewhere
a tossing sea, a stiff breeze above, and a sucking
tide below. Great cliffs hundreds of feet high
guard it, and from the top of them the land rolls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
away in long ridges, brown and bare. These wild
and rocky moors, full of pagan altars, stone crosses,
and memorials of the Jew, the Ph&oelig;nician, and the
Cornu-British, are the land of our childhood&rsquo;s fairy-folk&ndash;&ndash;the
home of Blunderbore and of Jack the Giant

<p>But it is the Undercliff which has the perennial
charm for humanity, for all along its sloping face
there are bewildering hummocks and hollows,
checkered with purple rocks and elder-trees. Narrow
footpaths curve in and out and up and down
among the fields and farms, the orchards and the
glimmering glades, and there the foxgloves grow
so tall that they lift their dappled bells level with
the eyes.</p>
<p>Further down are queer, quiet towns, hundreds of
years old, squeezed into the mouths of deep valleys&ndash;&ndash;valleys
full of delicate ferns and small wild roses
and the white heath, a flower peculiar to the locality.
And still lower&ndash;&ndash;on the very shingle&ndash;&ndash;are the amphibious-looking
cottages of the fishermen. They
are surrounded by nets and boats and lobster-pots.
Noisy children paddle in the flowing tide, and large,
brown, handsome women sit on the door-steps knitting
the blue guernsey shirts and stockings which
their husbands wear.</p>
<p>Such a lonely, lovely spot is the little village of
St. Penfer. It is so hidden in the clefts of the
rocks that unless one had its secret and knew the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
way of its labyrinth down the cliff-breast it would
be hard to find it from the landward side. But the
fishermen see its white houses and terraced gardens
and hear the sweet-voiced bells of its old church
calling to them when they are far off upon the
ocean. And well they know their cottages clustered
on the shingle below, and all day they may be seen
among them, mending their boats, or painting their
boats, or standing with their hands in their pockets
looking at their boats, fingering the while the bit of
mountain ash which they carry there to keep away
ill-luck.</p>
<p>John Penelles was occupied on the afternoon of
that Saturday which comes between Good Friday
and Resurrection Sunday. His boat was rocking on
the tide-top and he seemed to be looking at her.
But his bright blue eyes saw nothing seaward; he
was mentally watching the flowery winding way up
the cliff to St. Penfer. If his daughter Denas was
coming down it he would hear her footsteps in his
heart. And why did she not come? She had been
away four hours, and who knew what evil might
happen to a girl in four hours? When too late to
forbid her visit to St. Penfer, it had suddenly struck
him that Roland Tresham might be home for the
Easter holidays, and he disliked the young man.
He had an intuitive dislike for him, founded upon
that kind of &ldquo;I know&rdquo; which is beyond reasoning
with, and he had told Denas that Roland Tresham
was not for her to listen to and not for her to
trust to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there, then, &rsquo;tis dreadful! dreadful! What
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
foolishness a little maid will believe in!&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;I have never known but one woman who can
understand reason, and it isn&rsquo;t often she will listen
to it. Women! women! women! God bless them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was restless with his thoughts by the time they
arrived at this point, but it still took him a few
minutes to decide upon some action and then put
his great bulk into motion. For he was a large
man, even among Cornish fishermen, and his feet
were in his heavy fishing-boots, and his nature was
slow and irresolute until his mind was fully made
up. Then nothing could move him or turn him, and
he acted with that irresistible celerity which springs
from an invincible determination.</p>
<p>His cottage was not far off, and he went there.
As he approached, a woman rose from the steps
and, with her knitting in her hand, went inside.
She was putting the kettle on the fire as he entered,
and she turned her head to smile upon him. It
was a delightful smile, full of love and pleasure,
and she accompanied it with a little nod of her
head that meant any good thing he liked to ask of
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do think the little
maid is a sight too long away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She do have a long walk, John dear. St. Penfer
isn&rsquo;t at the door-step, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Joan, it is like this: Denas she be
what she is, thank God! but Roland Tresham, he
be near to the quality, and they do say a great
scholar, and can speak langwidges; and aw, my
dear, if rich and poor do ride together the poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
must ride behind, and a wayless way they take
through and over. I have seen that often and
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t be quick to think evil, John, must
we? I&rsquo;m sure Denas do know her place and her
right, and she isn&rsquo;t one to be put down below it.
You do take a sight of trouble you aren&rsquo;t asked to
take, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure you do. And they that go seeking
trouble are very like to find it. Is Roland Tresham
home again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know by certain. I haven&rsquo;t heard
tell so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now! How people do go thinking wrong
of others instead of themselves! That isn&rsquo;t the
Bible way, is it, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it isn&rsquo;t, Joan. But we aren&rsquo;t living
among Bible people, my dear, are we now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that, father. Fisher-folk
feature one another all the world over as much as
their lines and boats do. I think we could find
all those Galilean fishers among the fishers of
Penfer. I do, really&ndash;&ndash;plenty of Peters and sons of
Zebedee, I&rsquo;ll warrant. Are not John and Jacob
Tenager always looking to be high up in the chapel?
And poor Cruffs and Kestal, how they do deny all
the week through what they say on Sunday! And
I know one quiet, modest Andrew who never grumbles,
but is alway content and happy when his
brothers are favoured above him.&rdquo; And she looked
and smiled at her husband with such loving admiration
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
that the big fisherman felt the glow of the look
and smile warm his heart and flush his cheeks, and
he hastened to the tea-table, and was glad to be
silent and enjoy the compliment his dear Joan had
given him.</p>
<p>For Joan Penelles was not only a good wife, she
was a pious, truthful, sensible, patient woman. The
days of her youthful beauty were over, but her fine
face left the heart satisfied with her. There was
room in her eyes, light upon her face, strength and
mature grace in her tall figure&ndash;&ndash;the grace of a
woman who has grown up like a forest tree in fresh
air and winds and liberty&ndash;&ndash;the physical grace that
never comes by the dancing-master. And her print
dress and white kerchief and neatly braided hair
seemed as much a part of her charm as the thatched
roof, the yellow stone-wort, and the dainty little
mother of millions creeping over the roof and walls
were a part of the picturesque cottage. The beauty
of Joan Penelles was the beauty of fitness in every
part, of health, of good temper, of a certain spiritual
perception. Penelles loved her with a sure affection;
he trusted in her. In every strait of his life
he went to her for comfort or advice. He could not
have imagined a single day without Joan to direct it.</p>
<p>For his daughter Denas he had a love perhaps
not stronger, but quite different in kind. Denas
was his only living child. Denas loved the sea.
Penelles could remember her small pink feet in the
tide, when they were baby feet scarce able to stand
alone. As she grew older she often begged to go
to sea with the fishers, and on warm summer nights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
she had lain in the boat, and talked to him and his
mates, and sung them such wild, sweet songs that
the men vowed she charmed the fish into the nets.
For they had always wondrous takes when Denas
leaned over the gunwale, and in sweet, piercing
notes sang the old fishing-call:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Come, gray fish! gray fish!</p>
<p>Come from the gray cold sea!</p>
<p>Fathoms, fathoms deep is the wall of net.</p>
<p>Haddock! haddock! herring! herring!</p>
<p>Halibut! bass! whatever you be,</p>
<p>Fish! fish! fish! come pay your debt.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And while the men listened to the shrill, imperative
voice mingling with the wash of the waves, and
watched the child&rsquo;s long yellow hair catching the
glory of the moonlight, they let her lead them as
she would. She did not fear storms. It was her
father who feared them for her, though never after
one night when she was twelve years old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot go to-night, Denas,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the
tide is late and the wind is contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; the little maid answered with decision,
&ldquo;the contrary wind be God&rsquo;s wind. &rsquo;Twas
whist poor speed the fishers were once making&ndash;&ndash;toiling
and rowing&ndash;&ndash;and the wind contrary, when He
came walking on the water and into the boat, and
then, to be sure, all was quiet enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were no words to dispute this position, and
Denas went with the fishers, and sat singing like a
spirit while the boat kissed the wind in her teeth.
And anon the tide turned, and the wind changed,
and there was a lull, and so the nets were well shot,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
and they came back to harbour before the breeze
just at cock-light&ndash;&ndash;that is, when the cocks begin to
crow for the dawning.</p>
<p>Thus petted and loved, the pretty girl made her
way into all hearts, and when she said one day that
she wanted to go to the school at St. Penfer and
learn all about the strange seas and the strange
lands that were in the world, her father and mother
were quite thrilled by her great ambition. But she
had her desire, and for three years she went to the
private school at St. Penfer, and among the girls
gathered there made many friends. Chief among
these was Elizabeth Tresham, the daughter of a gentleman
who had bought, with the salvage of a large
fortune, the small Cornish estate on which he lived,
or rather fretted away life in vain regrets over an
irrevocable past. Elizabeth was his only daughter,
but he had a son who was much older than Elizabeth&ndash;&ndash;a
handsome, gay young man about whom little
was known in St. Penfer.</p>
<p>That little was not altogether favourable. It
was understood that he painted pictures and played
very finely on the piano, and every one could see
that he dressed in the most fashionable manner and
that he was handsome and light-hearted. But it
could not be hid that he often came for money, which
old Mr. Tresham had sometimes to borrow in St.
Penfer for him. And business men noted the fact
that his visits were so erratic and frequently so
long in duration that it was hardly likely he had
regular employment. And if a man had no private
steady income, then for him to be without steady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
daily labour was considered in St. Penfer suspicious
and not at all respectable. So in general Roland
Tresham was treated with a shy courtesy, which at
first he resented, but finally laughed at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squire Peverall is afraid of his daughter and
barely returns my bow, and the rector has sent his
pretty Phyllis to St. Ives while I am here, Elizabeth,&rdquo;
he said one night to his sister. &ldquo;Phyllis is
well enough, but she has not a shilling, and pray
who would marry Clara Peverall with only a paltry
twenty thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara is a nice girl, Roland, and if you only
would marry and settle down to a reasonable life,
how happy I should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I lead a more reasonable life, Elizabeth?
I manage to get more pleasure out of a hundred
pounds than some men get out of their thousands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And father and I carry the care of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very foolish. Why carry care? I do
not. I let the men to whom I owe money carry
the care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But father cannot do that&ndash;&ndash;nor can I. And to
be in debt, in St. Penfer, is disreputable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Elizabeth, is it reasonable that I should
suffer for father&rsquo;s and your inability to be happy,
or for the antiquated notions of such an antiquated
town as St. Penfer? I am only twenty-nine, and the
pleasures of life are necessities to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am only nineteen, Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then you are a girl&ndash;&ndash;that is such a different
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a different thing,&rdquo; and Elizabeth laid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
down the piece of linen she was stitching and
looked up at the handsome fellow who was leaning
against the open window and puffing his cigar
smoke out of it. She had the English girl&rsquo;s adoration
of the eldest son, and likewise her natural submission
to the masculine element. Besides which,
she loved Roland with all her simple faith and
affection. She loved him for his handsome self
and his charming ways. She loved him because
he had been her mother&rsquo;s idol, and she had promised
her mother never to desert Roland. She loved
him because he loved her in his own perfectly selfish
way. She was just as willing to bear his troubles,
and plan for their relief, and deny herself for
his pleasure, as Roland was willing to accept the
sacrifice. Of course she was foolish, perhaps sinfully
foolish, and it is no excuse for her folly to
admit that there are thousands of women in the same
transgression.</p>
<p>In one of his visits to St. Penfer, about two years
previous to this Easter Eve, Roland Tresham had
met Denas Penelles. At that time he had been
much interested in her. The little fisher-girl with
her piquant face, her strange haunting voice, and
her singular self-possession was a charming study.
He made several sketches of her, he set her wild,
sweet fisher-songs to music, he lent her books to
read, he talked to her and Elizabeth of the wonderful
London life which Elizabeth could partly remember,
but which was like a fairy-tale to Denas.</p>
<p>Fortunately Elizabeth was jealous of her brother
and jealous of her friend, and she never gave them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
any opportunity for private conversation. If Roland
proposed to see Denas down the cliff-breast, Elizabeth
was always delighted to go also. If Roland
asked Denas to go into the garden to gather fruit
or flowers, or into the drawing-room to sing her
songs to his accompaniments, Elizabeth was faithfully
at the side of Denas. She was actuated by a
variety of motives. She wished her brother to
make a prudent marriage. There were at least
three young girls in the vicinity eligible, and Elizabeth
believed that Roland had only to woo in
order to win. Any entanglement with Denas, therefore,
would be apt to delay such a settlement.</p>
<p>She liked Denas, and she did not wish to be the
means of giving her a heartache or a disappointment.
But she liked her as a friend and companion,
not as a probable sister. Mr. Tresham in
the days of his commercial glory had once been
Lord Mayor of London. Mrs. Tresham had been
&ldquo;presented,&rdquo; and the grand house and magnificent
entertainments of the Treshams were chronicled in
newspapers, which Elizabeth highly valued and
carefully treasured. She had also her full share of
that all-pervading spirit of caste which divides
English society into innumerable circles, and though
she did not dislike the tacit offence she gave to the
St. Penfer young ladies by selecting a companion
not in their ranks, she was always ready to defend
her friendship for Denas by an exaggerated description
of her many fine qualities. On this subject
she could air the extreme social views which she
heard from Roland, and which she always passionately
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
opposed when Roland advocated them; but she
was not any more ready to put her ideas of an
equality based on personal desert into practice
than was the most bigoted aristocrat of her acquaintance.</p>
<p>There was also another motive for her care of
Denas, a strong one, though Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind barely
recognised its existence. John Penelles, though
only a fisher, was a man who had influence and who
had saved money. Once when Mr. Tresham had
been in a great strait for cash, Penelles, remembering
Denas, had cheerfully loaned him a hundred
pounds. Elizabeth recollected her father&rsquo;s anxiety
and his relief and gratitude, and a friend who will
open, not his heart or his house, but his purse, is a
rare good friend, one not to be lightly wronged or
lost. Besides these reasons, there were many smaller
ones, arising out of petty social likes and dislikes
and jealousies, which made Miss Tresham determined
to keep Denas Penelles precisely in the position
to which she had at first admitted her&ndash;&ndash;that of
a friend and companion.</p>
<p>To visitors she often used the adjective &ldquo;humble&rdquo;
before the noun &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; glossing it with a somewhat
exaggerated account of Denas and their relationship,
but with Denas herself she never thought
of such qualification. Denas had all the native
independence of her class&ndash;&ndash;the fisher class, who
neither sow nor reap, but take their living direct
from the hand of God. She was proud of her
father, and proud of his boats, and proud of his skill
in managing them. She said, whenever she spoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
of him: &ldquo;My father is an upright man. He is a fine
sailor and a lucky fisher. Every one trusts my
father. Every one honours him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Denas recognised the differences in her
friend&rsquo;s life and her own. Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s old stone
mansion was large and lofty. It had fine gardens,
and it had been well furnished from the wreck of
the London house. Elizabeth played on the harp
and piano in a pretty, fashionable way, and she had
jewelry, and silk dresses, and many adornments
quite outside of the power of Denas to obtain. But
Denas never envied her these things. She looked
on them as the accidentals of a certain station, and
God had not put her in that station. In her own
she had the very best of all that belonged to it.
And as far as personal adornment went, she was
neither vain nor envious. Her dark-blue merino
dress and her wide straw hat satisfied her ideas of
propriety and beauty. A shell comb in her fair
hair and a few white hyacinths at her throat were
all the ornaments she desired. So dressed that Easter
Eve, she had stood a moment with her hat in her
hand before her mother, and asked, with a merry
little movement of her eyes and head, &ldquo;what she
thought of her?&rdquo; and Joan Penelles had told her
child promptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be sweet as blossoms, Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an engagement between her and Elizabeth
to adorn the altar for the Resurrection Service,
and it was mainly this duty which had delayed her
until John Penelles began to worry about her long
absence. He did not ask himself why he had all in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
a moment thought of Roland Tresham and felt a
shiver of apprehension. He was not accustomed to
reason about his feelings, it was so much easier to
go to Joan with them. But this evening Joan did
not quite satisfy him. He drank his tea and ate
plentifully of his favourite pie, of fresh fish and
cream and young parsley, and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan, my dear, I have an over-mind to light my
pipe and saunter up the cliff-breast. I may meet
Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t go, father. It do look as
if you had lost trust in Denas&ndash;&ndash;misdoubting one&rsquo;s
own is a whist poor business and not worth the following.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear, I just want to talk a few words to
her quiet-like. If Denas is companying with Roland
Tresham she oughtn&rsquo;t to do it, and I must tell her
so, that I must. My dear girl, right is right in the
devil&rsquo;s teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said the words so sternly that they seemed to
make a gloom in the cottage, but Joan&rsquo;s cheerful
laugh cleared it away. &ldquo;You be such a dear, good,
careful father, John,&rdquo; she said, as she tucked in with
a caressing movement the long ends of his kerchief.
&ldquo;I was only thinking that if it be good to watch,
it is far better to trust&ndash;&ndash;there then, isn&rsquo;t it, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, my dear, I&rsquo;ll watch first and I&rsquo;ll trust
after&ndash;&ndash;that&rsquo;s right enough, isn&rsquo;t it, Joan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan sighed and smiled, and Penelles, with his
pipe in his mouth, turned his face landward. Joan
thought a moment and then called to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! Paul Tynton is very bad to-day. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
was taken ill when the moon was three days old;
men die who sicken on that day. Hadn&rsquo;t you better
call and speak a word with him? He is in your
class, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was taken when the moon was four days old;
he&rsquo;ll have a hard little time, but he&rsquo;ll get up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was nothing else she could think of, and
she knit her brows and turned in to her house duties.
Joan did not want any meeting between her husband
and Roland Tresham. She did not want anything
to occur which would interfere with Denas visiting
Miss Tresham, for these visits were a source of great
pleasure to Denas and great pride to herself. And
Joan could not believe that there was any danger to
be feared from Roland; Denas had known him for
two years and nothing evil had yet happened. If
Roland had said one wrong word to Denas, Joan
was sure her child would have told her.</p>
<p>While she was thinking of these things, John
Penelles went slowly up the winding path that led
to the top of the cliff. It was sweet and bright on
either hand with the fragile, delicate flowers of early
spring. He stopped frequently to look at them,
and he longed to touch them, to hold them in his
palm, to put them against his lips. But he looked
at his big, hard hands, and then at the flowers, and
so, shaking his head, walked on. The blackbird
was piping and the missel-thrush singing in one or
two of her seven languages, and John felt the spring
joy stirring in his own heart to melody. He sat in
the singing-pew at St. Penfer Chapel, and he had a
noble voice, so he shook the ashes out of his pipe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
and clasping his hands behind his back was just
going to give the blackbirds and thrushes his evening
song, when he heard the rippling laugh of
Denas a little ahead of him.</p>
<p>He told himself in a moment that it was not her
usual laugh. He could not for his life have defined
the difference, but there it was. Before he saw her
he knew that Roland Tresham was with her, and in
a moment or two they came suddenly within his
vision. Denas was walking a little straighter than
usual, and Roland was bending toward her. He
was gay, laughing, finely dressed; he was doing his
best to attract the girl who walked so proudly, so
apart, and yet so happily beside him. Penelles
went forward to meet them. As they approached
Denas smiled, and the young man called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Penelles! How do you do? And what&rsquo;s
the news? And how is the fishing? I was just
bringing Denas home&ndash;&ndash;and hoping to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, sir, you can see for yourself how I be,
and the news be none, and the fishing be plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Penfer harbour is not much of a place,
Penelles. I was just telling Denas about London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Penfer be a hard little place, but it do give
us a living, sir; a honest living, thank God! Come,
Denas, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke he gently took the girl&rsquo;s hand, and
with a perfectly civil &ldquo;Good-evening, sir,&rdquo; turned
with her homeward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too fast, Penelles; I am going with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obliged; not to-night, sir. It be getting
late. Say good-evening, Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>There was something so final about the man&rsquo;s
manner that Roland was compelled to accept the
dismissal, but it deeply offended him, and the unreasonable
anger opened the door for evil thoughts;
and evil thoughts&ndash;&ndash;having a cursed and powerful
vitality&ndash;&ndash;immediately began to take form and to
make plans for their active gratification. Denas
walked silently down the narrow path before her
father. He could see by the way she carried herself
and by the swing of the little basket in her hand
that she was vexed, and he had a sense of injustice
in her attitude which he could not define, but which
wounded his great loving heart deeply. At last they
reached the shingle, and he strode to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be in a great hurry now, Denas,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to speak to my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, dear? Father will do as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t. Father is cruel cross to-night,
and thinking wrong of his girl and wrong of others
who meant no wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I be sorry enough, Denas. Come, my
dear, we won&rsquo;t quarrel for a bad man like Roland
Tresham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t bad, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is cruel bad&ndash;&ndash;worse than an innocent girl
can know. Aw, my dear, you must take father&rsquo;s
word for it. How was he walking with you to-night?
&rsquo;Twas some devil&rsquo;s miracle, I&rsquo;ll warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, then, it was not. He came from London on
the afternoon train, and Miss Tresham had a bad
headache and could not set me home as she always
does.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You should have come home alone. There was
nothing to fear you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the first time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, my dear, &rsquo;tis the last time. Mind that!
&rsquo;Twill be a bad hour for Roland Tresham if I see
him making love to my girl again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say a word of love to me, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, he was looking it&ndash;&ndash;more shame to him,
not to give looks words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot a man look at a pretty girl? I call that
nonsense, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland Tresham can&rsquo;t look at you, Denas, any
more as I saw him looking at you to-night&ndash;&ndash;bold
and free, and sure and laughing to his own heart for
the clever he was, and the devil in his eyes and on
his tongue. &rsquo;Twas all wrong, my dear, or I wouldn&rsquo;t
be feeling so hot and angry about it. I wouldn&rsquo;t
be feeling as if my heart was cut loose from its
moorings and sinking down and down as deep as
fear can send it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might trust me, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my sweet girl, there&rsquo;s times an angel can&rsquo;t
be trusted, or so many wouldn&rsquo;t have lost themselves.
It takes a man to know men and all the
wickedness mixed up in their flesh and blood.
There&rsquo;s your mother, Denas&ndash;&ndash;God bless her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan came strolling forward to meet them, her
large, handsome face beaming and shining with
love and pride. But she was immediately sensitive
to the troubled, angry atmosphere in which her
husband and child walked, and she looked into
John&rsquo;s face with the inquiry in her eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Denas is vexed about Roland Tresham, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There then, I thought Denas had more sense
than to trouble herself or you, father, with the like
of him. Your new frock is home, Denas, and pretty
enough, my dear. Go and look at it before it be
too dim to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas was glad to escape to her room, and Penelles
turned suddenly silent and said no more until
he had smoked another pipe on his own door-step.</p>
<p>Then he went into the cottage and sat down.
Joan was by the fire with her knitting in her hand,
and softly humming to herself her favourite hymn:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;When quiet in my house I sit.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Penelles let her finish, and then he told her all
that he saw and all that he thought and every word
he and Denas had spoken. &ldquo;And I said what was
right, didn&rsquo;t I, Joan?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No words at all are sometimes better than good
words, John. When the wicked was before him,
even David didn&rsquo;t dare to say good and right
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;David wasn&rsquo;t a St. Penfer fisherman, Joan, and
the wicked men of his day were a different kind of
wicked men&ndash;&ndash;they just thought of a bad thing and
went and did it. They didn&rsquo;t plot and plan how to
make others wicked for them and with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know wrong of Roland Tresham,
John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know wrong of Trelawny&rsquo;s little
Jersey bull? Nothing. It never hurt me yet. But
I see the devil in his eyes and in the lift of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
feet and the toss of his horns and the switch of
his tail, and I know right well he&rsquo;d rip me to pieces
if I&rsquo;d only give him the chance. That&rsquo;s the way I
know Roland Tresham is a bad one. I see the
devil in the glinting of his eyes and the mock of his
smile, and I wouldn&rsquo;t have been more sick frightened
to-night if I&rsquo;d seen a tiger purring around
Denas than I was when I got the first glimpse of
Tresham bending down, coaxing and flattering our
little girl. He&rsquo;s a bad man, sent with sorrow and
shame wherever he goes, and I know it just as I
know the long dead roll of the waves and the white
creeping mist&ndash;&ndash;like a dirty thief&ndash;&ndash;which makes me
cry out at sea &lsquo;All hands to reef! Quick! All
hands to reef!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There then, John, if wrong and danger there be,
what must be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep the little maid out of it. Don&rsquo;t let her go
to Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s. I wouldn&rsquo;t hear tell of it. If
Denas would only listen a bit to Tris Penrose, he&rsquo;d
be the man for her&ndash;&ndash;a good man, a good sailor,
and he do love the very stones Denas steps on, he
do for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to like Tris, but these few months her
love has all quailed away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis dreadful! dreadful! Why did God Almighty
make women so? Here be good love going
a-begging to them and getting nothing but a frown
and a hard word, while devil&rsquo;s love is fretted for
and heart-nursed. Whatever is a woman&rsquo;s love made
of, I do wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he asked the question he knocked his pipe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
against the jamb to clean it out, and then quickly
turned his head, for an inner door opened and Denas
peeped out and then came forward and put her arm
around his neck and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s love or man&rsquo;s love, who knows how
God makes it, father? And the fisherman&rsquo;s poet&ndash;&ndash;a
far wiser man than most men&ndash;&ndash;asks and answers
the same troublesome question in his way. What is
love? How does it come?</p>

<p>For a woman; that&rsquo;s harder still, isn&rsquo;t it, father?
But never fret yourself, father, for Denas loves you

slipped on to his knee and stretched out her hand
to her mother, and so, kissing the tears off her
father&rsquo;s face and the smiles off her mother&rsquo;s lips,
she went happily to her sleep.</p>
<p>And a great trust came into the father&rsquo;s and
mother&rsquo;s hearts; they spoke long of their hopes and
plans for her happiness, and then, stepping softly to
her bedside, they blessed her in her sleep. And she
was dreaming of Roland Tresham. So mighty is
love, and yet so ignorant; so strong, and yet so
weak; so wise, and yet so easily deceived.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> thing Elizabeth Tresham had done her best
to prevent had really happened, but she was
not much to blame. Circumstances quite unexpectedly
had disarranged her plans and made her physically
unable to keep her usual guard over her companion.
In fact, Elizabeth&rsquo;s own love-affairs that
eventful Saturday demanded all her womanly diplomacy
and decision.</p>
<p>Miss Tresham had the two lovers supposed to be
the lot of most women&ndash;&ndash;the ineligible one, whom
she contradictively preferred, and the eligible one,
who adored her in spite of all discouragements.
The first was the young rector of St. Penfer, a man
to whom Elizabeth ascribed every heavenly perfection,
but who in the matter of earthly goods had not
been well considered by the church he served. The
living of St. Penfer was indeed a very poor one, but
then the church itself was early Norman and the
rectory more than two hundred years old. Elizabeth
thought poverty might at least be picturesque
under such conditions; and at nineteen years of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
age poverty has a romantic colouring if only love
paint it.</p>
<p>Robert Burrell, the other lover, had nothing romantic
about him, not even poverty. He was unpoetically
rich&ndash;&ndash;he even trafficked in money. The rector
was a very young man; Burrell was thirty-eight
years old. The rector wrote poetry, and understood
Browning, and recited from Arnold and Morris.
Burrell&rsquo;s tastes were for social science and statistics.
He was thoughtful, intelligent, well-bred, and reticent;
small in figure, with a large head and very
fine eyes. The rector, on the contrary, was tall and
fair, and so exceedingly handsome that women especially
never perceived that the portal to all his
senses was small and low and that he was incapable
of receiving a great idea.</p>
<p>On that Saturday morning Robert Burrell resolved
to test his fate, and he wrote to Miss Tresham.
It was a letter full of that passionate adoration he
was too timid to personally offer, and his protestations
were honourably certified by the offer of his
hand and fortune. It was a noble letter; a letter
no woman could easily put aside. It meant to
Elizabeth a sure love to guard and comfort her and
an absolute release from the petty straits and anxieties
of genteel poverty. It would make her the
mistress of the finest domestic establishment in the
neighbourhood&ndash;&ndash;it would give her opportunities for
helping Roland to the position in life he ought to
occupy; and this thought&ndash;&ndash;though an after one&ndash;&ndash;had
a great influence on Elizabeth&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>After some consideration she took the letter to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
her father. He was in one of his most querulous
moods, ill-disposed to believe in any good thing
coming to him. He read the letter under such
influence, and yet he could not but be sensible of its
importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a piece of unexpected good fortune for you,
Elizabeth,&rdquo; he said with a sigh. &ldquo;Of course it will
leave me alone here, but I do not mind that now;
all else has gone&ndash;&ndash;why not you? I thought, however,
the rector was your choice. I hope you have
no entanglement there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never asked me to be his wife, but he
has constantly shown that he wished it. He is
poor&ndash;&ndash;I think he felt that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has made love to you, called you the fairest
girl on earth, made you believe he lived only in your
presence, and so on, and so on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has talked in that way for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never intends to ask you to marry him. He
asked Dr. Eyre if you had any fortune. Oh, I know
his kind and their ways!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are mistaken, father. If he knew
Mr. Burrell wished to marry me he would venture
to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he would? I am sure he would not&ndash;&ndash;but
here the gentleman comes. I will speak a few
words to him and then he will speak to you, and
after that you can answer Mr. Burrell&rsquo;s letter.
Stay a moment, Elizabeth. It is only fair to tell
you that I have no money but my annuity. When I
die you will be penniless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Elizabeth went out of the room silent and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
her head drooping a little. The word &ldquo;penniless&rdquo;
was a shock to her. She sat down in a large chair
<a name='TC_1'></a><ins title="Was 'wth'">with</ins> her back to the light and shut her eyes. She
wished to set the two men clearly before her. It
would be easy to love Robert Burrell if she did not
love the other. Did she love the other? She examined
her heart pitilessly, and found always some
little &ldquo;if&rdquo; crouching in a corner. In some way or
other it was evident she did not believe &ldquo;the other&rdquo;
would stand trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Tresham had the same opinion in a more
positive form, and he was quite willing to test it.
He met the rector with more effusion than was usual
with him, and putting on his hat said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk around the garden with me, sir. I have
something to say to you, and as I am a father you
must permit me to speak very plainly. I believe
you are in love with Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer from the young man, and
his face was pale and angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir! Am I right or wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I respect and like Miss Tresham. Everyone
must do so, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you asked her to marry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, no! Nothing of the kind, sir; nothing
of the kind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought not. Well, you see, sir, your dangling
about my house keeps honest men outside, and
I would be obliged to you, sir&ndash;&ndash;in fact, sir, I require
you at once to make Miss Tresham understand that
your protestations are lies&ndash;&ndash;simple and straightforward
lies, sir. I insist on your telling her that your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
love-making is your amusement and girls&rsquo; hearts
the pawns with which you play. You will tell
her that you are a scoundrel, sir! And when you
have explained yourself to Miss Tresham, you had
better give the same information to Miss Trelawny,
and to Miss Rose Trefuses, and to that poor little
sewing-girl you practise your recitations on. Sir,
I have the greatest contempt for you, and when you
have spoken to Miss Tresham, you will leave my
house and come here no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give me pleasure to obey you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he turned from the contemptuous
old man, and in a hurried, angry mood sought Elizabeth
in her usual sitting-room.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes as he opened the door and
looked at him. Then she rose and went toward
him. He waved her away imperatively and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Elizabeth! No! I have no caress for you
to-day! I do not think I shall ever feel lovingly
to you again. Why did you tell your father anything?
I thought our love was a secret, sacred
affair. When I am brought to catechism about my
heart matters, I shut my heart close. I am not to
be hectored and frightened into marrying any
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you remember whose presence you are in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wanted to be my wife&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want to be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you loved me in the least&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not love you in the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come here no more. O Elizabeth! Only
to think!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you come here no more. I see that
you judge the honour and fulness of my heart by
the infidelity and emptiness of your own. Go, sir,
and remember, you discard not me&ndash;&ndash;I discard you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus speaking she passed him haughtily, and he
put out his hand as if to detain her, but she gathered
her drapery close and so left him. Mr. Tresham
heard her footsteps and softly opened the door of
his library. &ldquo;Come in here, Elizabeth,&rdquo; he said
with some tenderness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he brought you the news of his own dishonour.
Let him go. He is as weak as a bent flax-stalk,
and to be weak is to be wicked. Bury your
disappointment in your heart, do not even tell
Denas&ndash;&ndash;girls talk to their mothers and mothers talk
to all and sundry. Turn your face to Burrell Court
now&ndash;&ndash;it is a fair fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it may be a good thing for poor Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may. A respectable position and a certain
income is often salvation for a man. Write to Mr.
Burrell at once, and send the letter by the gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was an easy direction to give, but Elizabeth
did not find it easy to carry out. She wrote half-a-dozen
letters, and none of them was satisfactory.
So she finally asked her lover to call and see her at
seven o&rsquo;clock that evening. And it was very natural
that, in the stress of such an important decision,
the visit of Denas and their intention of dressing
the altar should be forgotten. It was a kind of unpleasant
surprise to her when Denas came and she
remembered the obligation. Of course she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
not now refuse to fulfil it. The offering was surely
to God, and no relation between herself and the
rector could interfere with it. But it was a great
trial. She said she had a headache, and perhaps
that complaint as well as any other defined the hurt
and shock she had received.</p>
<p>Denas wondered at Elizabeth&rsquo;s want of interest.
She did not superintend as usual the cutting of the
flowers, so carefully nursed and saved for this occasion;
and though she went to the church with
Denas and really did her best to make a heart offering
with her Easter wreaths, the effort was evident.
Her work lacked the joyous enthusiasm which had
always distinguished Elizabeth&rsquo;s church duties.</p>
<p>The rector pointedly ignored her, and she felt
keenly the curious, and in some cases the not kindly,
glances of the other Easter handmaidens. In such
celebrations she had always been put first; she was
now last&ndash;&ndash;rather, she was nowhere. It would have
been hard to bear had she not known what a triumph
she held in abeyance. For Mr. Burrell was the
patron of St. Penfer&rsquo;s church; he had given its fine
chime of bells and renovated its ancient pews of
black oak. The new organ had been his last Christmas
gift to the parish, and out of his purse mainly
had come the new school buildings. The rector
might ignore Miss Tresham, but she smiled to herself
when she reflected on the salaams he would yet
make to Mrs. Robert Burrell.</p>
<p>Now, Denas was not more prudent than young
girls usually are. She saw that there was trouble,
and she spoke of it. She saw Elizabeth was slighted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
and she resented it. It was but natural under such
circumstances that the church duty was made as
short as possible; and it was just as natural that
Elizabeth should endeavour to restore her self-respect
by a confidential revelation of the great
matrimonial offer she had received. And perhaps
she did nothing unwomanly in leaving Denas freedom
to suppose the rector&rsquo;s insolent indifference
the fruit of his jealousy and disappointment.</p>
<p>In the midst of these pleasant confidences Roland
unexpectedly entered. He had written positively
that he was not coming. And then here he
was. &ldquo;I thought I could not borrow for the trip, but
I managed it,&rdquo; he said with the bland satisfaction
of a man who feels that he has accomplished a praiseworthy
action. For once Elizabeth was not quite
pleased at his visit. She would rather it had not
occurred at such an important crisis of her life. She
was somewhat afraid of Roland&rsquo;s enthusiasms and
rapid friendships, and it was not unlikely that his
first conception of Mr. Burrell&rsquo;s alliance would be
&ldquo;a good person to borrow money from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also she wished time to dress herself carefully
and solitude to get the inner woman under control.
After five o&rsquo;clock Denas and Roland were both in
her way. They were at the piano singing as complacently
and deliberately as if the coming of her
future husband was an event that could slip into
and fit into any phase of ordinary life. It was a
strange, wonderful thing to her, something so sacred
and personal she could not bear to think of discussing
it while Roland laughed and Denas sang. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
was not an every-day event and she would not have
it made one.</p>
<p>She knew her father would not interfere, and she
knew one way in which to rid herself of Denas and
Roland. Naturally she took it. A little after six
she said: &ldquo;I have a headache, Roland, and shall not
walk to-night. Will you take Denas safely down
the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland was delighted, and Denas was no more
afraid of the gay fellow than the moth is of the
candle. She was pleasantly excited by the idea of
a walk all alone with Roland. She wondered what
he would say to her: if he would venture to give
voice to the inarticulate love-making of the last two
years&ndash;&ndash;to all that he had looked when she sang to
him&ndash;&ndash;to all that he meant by the soft, prolonged
pressure of her hand and by that one sweet stolen
kiss which he had claimed for Christmas&rsquo; sake.</p>
<p>They walked a little apart and very silently until
they came into the glades of the cliff-breast. Then,
suddenly, without word or warning, Roland took
Denas in his arms and kissed her. &ldquo;Denas! sweet
Denas!&rdquo; he cried, and the wrong was so quickly,
so impulsively committed that for a moment Denas
was passive under it. Then with flaming cheeks
she freed herself from his embrace. &ldquo;Mr. Tresham,
you must go back,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can walk no further
with you. Why were you so rude to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not rude, Denas, and I will not go back.
After waiting two years for this opportunity, do you
think I will give it up? And I will not let you call
me Mr. Tresham. To you I am Roland. Say it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
here in my arms, dear, lovely Denas! Do not turn
away from me. You cannot go back without telling
Elizabeth, and I swear you shall not go forward until
you forgive me. Come, Denas, sweet, forgive me!&rdquo;
He held her hands, he kissed her hands, and would
not release the girl, who, as she listened to his rapid,
eager pleading, became more and more disposed to
tenderness. He was telling the story no one could
better tell than Roland Tresham. His eyes, his
lips, his smile, his caressing attitudes, all went with
his eager words, his enthusiastic admiration, his
passionate assertion of his long-hidden affection.</p>
<p>And everything was in his favour. The lovely
spring eve, the mystical twilight, the mellow flutings
of the blackbirds and the vesper thrushes piping
nothing new or strange, only the sweet old tune of
love, the lift of the hills, the soft trinkling of
hidden brooks, the scent of violets at their feet
and of the fresh leaves above them&ndash;&ndash;all the magic
of the young year and of young love made the delicious
story Roland had been longing to tell and the
innocent heart of Denas fearing and longing to hear
very easy to interpret&ndash;&ndash;very easy to understand.</p>
<p>Listening, and then refusing to listen; yielding a
little, and then drawing back again, Denas nevertheless
heard Roland&rsquo;s whole sweet confession. She
was taught to believe that he had loved her from
their first meeting; taught to believe and half-made
to acknowledge that she had not been indifferent to
him. She was under almost irresistible influences,
and she did not think of others which might have
counteracted them. Even Elizabeth&rsquo;s revelation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
to her of her own splendid matrimonial hopes was
favourable to Roland&rsquo;s arguments; for if it was a
thing for congratulating and rejoicing that Elizabeth
should marry a man so much richer than herself,
where was it wrong for Denas to love one supposed
to be socially and financially her superior?</p>
<p>Before they were half-way to the shingle Roland
felt that he had won. The conviction gave him a
new kind of power&ndash;&ndash;the power all women delight to
acknowledge; the sweet dictation, the loving tyranny
that claims every thought of the beloved. Roland
told Denas she must not dare to remember anyone
but him; he would feel it and know it if she did.
She promised this readily. She must not tell Elizabeth.
Elizabeth was unreasonable, she was even
jealous of everything concerning her brother; she
would have a hundred objections; she would influence
his father unfavourably; she would do all she
could to prevent their seeing each other, etc., etc.
And where a man pleads, one woman is readily persuaded
against another. But Denas was much
harder to persuade where the article of secrecy
touched her father and mother. Her conscience,
uneasy for some time, told her positively at this
point that deception was wicked and dangerous.
Roland could not win from her a promise in this direction.
But he was not afraid&ndash;&ndash;he was sure he could
trust to her love and her desire to please him.</p>
<p>One of the cruellest things about a wrong love is
that it delights in tangles and hidden ways; that it
teaches and practises deceit from its first inception;
that its earliest efforts are toward destroying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
all older and more sacred attachments. Roland
was not willing to take the hand of Denas in the
face of the world and say: &ldquo;This is my beloved
wife.&rdquo; Yet for the secret pleasure of his secret
love, he expected Denas to wrong father-love and
mother-love and to deceive day by day the friend
and the companion who had been so kind and so
fairly loyal to her.</p>
<p>No wonder John Penelles hated him instinctively.
John&rsquo;s soul needed but a glimpse of the lovers sauntering
down the narrow cliff-path to apprehend the
beginning of sorrows. Instantaneous as the glimpse
was, it explained to him the restless, angry, fearful
feeling that had driven him from his own cottage to
the place appointed by destiny for the revelation of
his child&rsquo;s danger and of his own admonition.</p>
<p>He was glad that he had obeyed the spiritual
order; whatever power had warned him had done
him service. It is true the fond assurances of Denas
had somewhat pacified his suspicions, but he was
not altogether satisfied. When Denas declared that
Roland had not made love to her, John felt certain
that the girl was in some measure deceiving him&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
deceiving herself; for he could not imagine
her to be guilty of a deliberate lie. Alas! lying
is the vital air of secret love, and a girl must needs
lie who hides from her parents the object and the
course of her affections. Still, when he thought of
her arms around his neck, of her cheek against his
cheek, of her assertion that &ldquo;Denas loved no one
better than her father and mother,&rdquo; he felt it a kind
of disloyalty to his child to altogether doubt her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
He believed that Denas believed in herself. Well,
then, he must try and trust her as far and as long
as it was possible.</p>
<p>And Joan trusted her daughter&ndash;&ndash;she scouted the
idea of Denas doing anything that was outside her
mother&rsquo;s approval. She told John that his fear
was nothing but the natural conceit of men; they
thought a woman could not be with one of their
sex and not be ready to sacrifice her own life and
the lives of all her kinsfolk for him. &ldquo;It be such
puddling folly to start with,&rdquo; she said indignantly;
&ldquo;talking about Denas being false to her father and
mother! &rsquo;Tis a doleful, dismal, ghastly bit of
cowardice, John. Dreadful! aw, dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then John was silent, but he communed with his
own heart. Joan had not seen Roland and Denas
as he had seen them; no one had troubled Joan as
he had been troubled. For something often gives to
a loving heart a kind of prescience, when it may be
used for wise and saving ends; and John Penelles
divined the angry trend of Roland&rsquo;s thoughts, though
it was impossible for him to anticipate the special
form that trend would take.</p>
<p>Roland had indeed been made furiously angry at
the interference between himself and Denas. &ldquo;I
spoke pleasantly to the old fisher, and he was as
rude as could be. Rude to me! Jove! I&rsquo;ll teach
him the value of good manners to his betters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down on a lichen-covered rock, lit a cigar,
and began to think. His personal dignity had been
deeply wounded; his pride of petty caste trod upon.
He, a banker&rsquo;s son, had been snubbed by a common
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
fisherman! &ldquo;He took Denas from me as if I was
going to kill her, body and soul. He deserves all
he suspected me of.&rdquo; And as these and similar
thoughts passed through Roland&rsquo;s mind he was not
at all handsome; his face looked dark and drawn
and marked all over with the characters sin writes
through long late hours of selfish revelry and riot.</p>
<p>But however his angry thoughts wandered, they
always came back to the slight of himself personally&ndash;&ndash;to
the failure of Penelles to appreciate the
honour he was doing him in wooing his daughter.
And if the devil wishes to enter easily a man or a
woman, he finds no door so wide and so easy of
access as the door of wounded vanity and wounded
self-esteem.</p>
<p>Roland&rsquo;s first impulse was to make Denas pay her
father&rsquo;s debt. &ldquo;I will never speak to her again.
Common little fisher-girl! I will teach her that
gentlemen are to be used like gentlemen. Why
did she not speak up to her father? She stood
there without a word and let him snub me. The
idea!&rdquo; These exclamations were, however, only the
quick, unreasoning passion of the animal; when Roland
had calmed himself with tobacco, he felt how
primitive and foolish they were. His reflections
were then of a different character; they began to
flow steadily into a channel they had often wandered
in, though hitherto without distinct purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, I like the girl. She has a kind of
nixie, tantalising, bewitching charm that would
drive a crowd mad. She has a fresh, sympathetic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
voice, penetrating, too, as a clarion. Her folk-songs
and her sea-songs go down to the bottom of a man&rsquo;s
heart and into every corner of it. Now, if I could
get her to London and have her taught how to manage
her voice and face and person, if I had her
taught how to dance&ndash;&ndash;Jove! there is a fortune in
it! Dressed in a fancy fisher costume, singing the
casting songs and the boat songs&ndash;&ndash;the calls and
takes she knows so well&ndash;&ndash;why, she would make a
gas-lit theatre seem like the great ocean, and men
would see the white-sailed ships go marching by,
and the fishing cobbles, and the wide nets full of
gleaming fish, and&ndash;&ndash;and, by Jove! they would go
frantic with delight. They would be at her feet.
She would be the idol of London. She would sing
full pockets empty. I should have all my desires,
and now I have so few of them. What a prospect!
But I&rsquo;ll reach it&ndash;&ndash;I&rsquo;ll reach it, and all the fishers
in St. Penfer&rsquo;s shall not hinder me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought his plans over again, and then it was
dark and he rose up to return home; but as he shook
himself into the proper fit of his clothes and settled
his hat at the correct angle, he laughed vauntingly
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be even with you, John Penelles, before
next Easter. I was not good enough for Denas,
was I not? Well, she is going to work for me and
for my pleasure and profit, John Penelles; going to
make money for me to spend, John Penelles. My
beautiful fisher-maid! I dare be bound she is dreaming
of me now. Women! women! women! What
dear little fools they are, to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></div>
<p>He was quite excited and quite good-tempered
now. A new plan was like a new fortune to Roland.
He never took into consideration the contrariness
of circumstances and of opposing human elements.
His plans were perfect from his own standpoint;
the standpoint of other people was out of his
consideration. Never before had he conceived so
clever a scheme for getting a livelihood made for
him. There was really nobody but Denas to interfere
with any of his arrangements, and Denas was
under his control and could be made more so. This
night he felt positive that he had &ldquo;hit the very
thing at last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached home late, but in exuberant spirits.
Elizabeth was waiting for him. She was beautifully
dressed, and in a moment he saw upon her
hand the flash of large and perfect diamonds. &ldquo;They
were mother&rsquo;s, I suppose, and I have as much right&ndash;&ndash;yes,
more right&ndash;&ndash;to them than she has.&rdquo; This was
his first thought, but he did not express it. There
was an air about Elizabeth that was quite new to
him; he was curious and full of expectation as he
seated himself beside her. She shook her head in
a reproving manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been making love to Denas. I see it
in your eyes, Roland. And you promised me you
never would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour, Elizabeth. We met the old
fisher Penelles a long way up the cliff and he took
her from me. Talking of making love&ndash;&ndash;pray, what
have you been doing? I thought you had a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Roland, I am going to be married&ndash;&ndash;June the
11th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your engagement ring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is. Mr. Burrell says it was his mother&rsquo;s engagement
ring; but, then, gems are all second-hand&ndash;&ndash;a
hundred-hand&ndash;&ndash;a thousand-hand for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burrell! You take my breath away! Burrell!
The man who has a bank in Threadneedle Street?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Elizabeth! You have made all
our fortunes! You noble girl! I did not know he
was thinking of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was waiting for me. Destiny, Roland. But
he is a noble-hearted man, and he loves me and I
intend to be a good wife to him. I do indeed. He
is going to make a great settlement on me, and I
shall have an income of my own from it&ndash;&ndash;all my
own, to do what I like with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth, dear, I always have loved you better
than anything else in the world. You will not forget
me now, will you, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Roland, I thought of you when I accepted
Mr. Burrell. When I am married, Roland, I shall
manage things for you as you wish them, I daresay.
The man loves me so much that I could get not
the half, but the whole of his kingdom from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the dearest, noblest sister in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not bear to go to sleep without making
you as happy as myself. Now, Roland, there is
something you must not do, and that is, have any
love nonsense with Denas Penelles. At Burrell
Court you will meet rich girls and girls of good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
birth, and your only chance is in a rich marriage&ndash;&ndash;you
know it is, Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not quite think that, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland, you know it. How many situations
have you had and lost? If Mr. Burrell gave you a
desk in his bank to-morrow, you would hand back
its key before my wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but there are other ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None for you but a rich marriage. Every other
way supposes work, and you will not work. You
know you will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some objections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, any trouble with a fisherman&rsquo;s daughter
would be bad every way. There is the dislike rich
girls have for low amours, and, worse still, the dreadfully
Cornish habit fishers have of standing together.
If you offend John Penelles or wrong him in the
least, you offend and wrong every man in St. Penfer
fishing quarter. Do not snap your fingers so scornfully,
Roland; you would be no match for a banded
enmity like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this about Denas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; all this about Denas. The girl is a vain
little thing, but I do not want to see her breaking
her heart about your handsome face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew the handsome face down to her lips and
kissed it; and Roland used every charm he possessed
in order to deepen his influence over his going-to-be-rich
sister. He was already making plain and
straight his paths for a certain supremacy at Burrell
Court. He was already feeling that a good deal of
Robert Burrell&rsquo;s money would come, through Elizabeth&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
hands, into his pocket. That would be a perfectly
legitimate course for it to take. Why should
not a loving sister help a loving brother?</p>
<p>And oh, the pity of it! While brother and sister
talked only of themselves, Robert Burrell sat silent
and happy in his study, planning magnificent generosities
for his bride; thinking of her youth, of her
innocence, her ignorance of fashionable society, of
her affection for and her loyalty to her father and
brother, and loving her with all his great honest
heart for these very things. And Denas lay dreaming
of Roland. And Roland, even while he was talking
with Elizabeth about Burrell Court, was holding
fast to his intention to degrade Denas. For the
singing, dancing, fiddling life which he was to lead
with her suited his tastes exactly; he felt it would
be the absolutely necessary alterative to the
wealthy decorum of Burrell Court.</p>
<p>O Love! what cruelties are done in thy name!
We think of thee as coming with a rose, and a song,
and a smile. Nay, but the Calydonian Maidens

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">John Penelles</span> was one of those strong
religious characters whose minds no questions
disturb, whose spiritual aspirations are never
put out of breath. He had not yet been a yoke-fellow
with sorrow. Hard work, the cruelty of the
elements, the self-denials of poverty, these things
he had known; but love had never smitten him
across the heart.</p>
<p>When he rose that Easter Sunday he rose singing.
He sang as he put on his chapel broadcloth;
he was trying over the different metres and the Easter
anthem as he walked about the sanded floor of
his cottage, and thought over the heads of his sermon.
For he was to preach that night in the little
chapel of St. Swer, a fishing hamlet four miles to
the northward; indeed, John preached very often,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
being a local preacher in the circuit of St. Penfer,
and rather famous for his ready, short sermons, full
of the breath of the sea and of the savour of the
fisher&rsquo;s life upon it.</p>
<p>Denas had gone to a neighbouring farm for milk.
He heard her quick step on the shingle, and he
stood still in the middle of the floor to meet her.
She had on a short dress of pink calico and a square
of blue-and-white-plaided flannel thrown over her
head. She came in like the breath of the spring
Sabbath. Her face was rosy, her lovely lips slightly
apart, her blue eyes dewy and soft and bright and
brimming with love. She lifted her face to her
father&rsquo;s face, and he forgot in a moment all his
fears. He saw only Denas, and not any of her
faults; if she had faults, he buried them that moment
in his love, and they were all put out of memory.</p>
<p>Roland and the Treshams were not spoken of.
John and Joan both had the fisher&rsquo;s dislike to name
a person or a thing they considered unlucky or
unpleasant. &ldquo;If you name evil you do call evil&rdquo;
was their simple creed; and it saved many a household
worry. They sat down to their breakfast of
tea, and fresh fish, and white loaf, and the wide-open
door let in the sea wind, and the sea smell, and
the soft murmur of the turning tide. John&rsquo;s heart
was full of holy joy; he could feel it singing:
&ldquo;Bless the Lord, O my soul!&rdquo; And though he was
only a poor Cornish fisher, he was sure that the
world was a very good world and that life was well
worth the living.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Bible do tell us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
that there shall be a new earth. Can it be a sweeter
one than this is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, John, it may be a sight better, for we be
promised &lsquo;there shall be no sea there,&rsquo; thank God!
no freezing, drowning men and no weeping wives.
I do think of that when you are out in the frost and
storm, John, and the thought be heaven itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, the sea be God&rsquo;s own highway. There
be wonders by the sea. Was not St. John sent to
the sea-side for the Revelations? &rsquo;Twas there he
heard the angels, whose voices were like the sound
of many waters. Heaven will be wonderful! wonderful!
if it do make us forget the sea. Aw, my dear
Joan, &rsquo;twill be something added to this earth, not
something taken away, and the good thing added
will make both the sea and the &lsquo;bounds of the everlasting
hills&rsquo; to be blessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, who told you that? And if the cruel,
hungry, awful sea is not to be taken away, nor yet
the &lsquo;everlasting hills,&rsquo; what will make it a new
earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s tabernacle will be in it. Aw, my dear,
that will make everything new&ndash;&ndash;sea and land, men
and women; and then there will be no more tears.
My dear, when I think of that I love this old world,
not only for what it is, but also for what it is going
to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you are preaching and not eating your
breakfast; and I want to get breakfast over and
the cups washed, for I have to dress myself yet,
and a new dress to put on, too,&rdquo; and Denas smiled
and nodded and touched her father&rsquo;s big hand with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
her small one, and then John smiled back, and with
a mighty purpose began to eat his fish and bread
and drink his tea.</p>
<p>The whole day took its colour from this happy
beginning. In after-years John often spoke of that
Easter Sabbath; of their quiet walk all together up
the cliff to St. Penfer Chapel; of the singing, and
the sermon, and the Sunday-school in the afternoon
for the fisher children; of the walk to St. Swer with
Denas by his side and the walk back, singing all
the way home; of the nice supper ready for them,
and how they had eaten and talked till the late moon
made a band of light across the table, and John
said hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there now! The tide will be calling me
before I do have time to get sleep in my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan rose quickly and Denas began to put
away the bread and cheese and milk, and though
none recognised the fact at the time, the old life
passed away for ever when the three rose from that
midnight supper.</p>
<p>Yet for several days afterward nothing seemed
to be changed. John went to his fishing and had
unusual good fortune; and Joan and Denas were
busy mending nets and watching the spring bleaching.
It was the duty of Denas to take the house
linen to some level grassy spot on the cliff-breast
and water and watch it whiten in the sunshine.
Monday she had gone to this duty with a vague hope
that Roland would seek her out. She watched all
day for him. She knew that she was looking pretty,
and she felt that her employment was picturesque.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>As she stood over the breadths of damask, with
the water-can making mimic rain upon them, she was
well aware that all her surroundings added charm
to her charm. The soft winds blowing her hair and
her pink skirt; the green leaves whispering above
and around her; the rippling of the brook running
down the hillside&ndash;&ndash;all these things belonged as
much to her as the frame belongs to the picture.
Why did not Roland come to see her thus? Was he
afraid for the words he had said to her? Were they
not true words? Did he intend, by ignoring them,
to teach her that he had only been playing with her
vanity and her credulity?</p>
<p>Tuesday was too wet and blowy to spread the
linen, and Denas felt the morning insufferably long
and tedious. Her father, who had been on the sea
all night, dozed in his big chair on the hearthstone.
Joan was silent, and went about her duties in a tiptoeing
way that was very fretful to the impatience
of Denas. Denas herself was knitting a guernsey,
and as she sat counting the stitches Tristram Penrose
came to the door and, after a moment&rsquo;s pause,
spoke to her. He was a fine young fellow with an
open-air look on his brown face and an open-love
look in his brown eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Denas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is your father in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tris, who gave you license to call me dear? and
my father is asleep by the fireside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, the One who gave me license to live
gave me the license to love; and dear you be and
dear you always will be to Tris Penrose. The
word may be shut in my heart or I may say it in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
your ear, Denas; &rsquo;tis all the same; dear you be and
dear you always will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders petulantly, and yet
could not resist the merry up-glance which she
knew went straight to the big fellow&rsquo;s heart. Then
she began to fold up her knitting. While Tris was
talking to her father, she would ask for permission
to go and see Elizabeth. While Tris was present,
she did not think he would refuse her request, for if
he did so she could ask him for reasons and he
would not like to give them.</p>
<p>Denas had all the natural diplomacy of a clever
woman, and she knew the power of a fond word
and a sunny smile. &ldquo;Father&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;is there any fonder
word?&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Father, I want to go and see Miss Tresham.
She told me a very important secret on Saturday,
and I know she was expecting me yesterday to talk
it over with her;&rdquo; then she went close to his side
and put her hand on his shoulder and snuggled her
cheek in his big beard, and called poor Tris&rsquo; soul
into his face for the very joy of watching her.</p>
<p>John was not insensible to her charming. He
hesitated, and Denas felt the hesitation and met it
with a bribe: &ldquo;You could come up the cliff to meet
me before you go to the boats&ndash;&ndash;couldn&rsquo;t you, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, my dear, I&rsquo;ll not need to look for you on
the cliff, for you will stay at home, Denas; it rains&ndash;&ndash;it
blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Tresham was expecting me all through yesterday,
but it was so fine I took the linen to bleach.
She will be so disappointed if I do not come to-day.
We have a secret, father&ndash;&ndash;a very particular secret.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>It was hard to resist the pretty, pleading, coaxing
girl, but John had a strength of will which Denas
had never before put to the test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if Miss Tresham
be longing to talk her secrets to you, she can come
to you. There be nothing in the world to hinder
her. Here be a free welcome to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity you did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must stay at home. &rsquo;Twould be like putting
my girl through the fire to Baal to send her
into the company there be now at Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing for the company. I want to see
Miss Tresham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, I am in earnest, Denas. You shall
not go. Take your knitting and sit down to your
own work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her knitting, but she did not lift a
stitch. Where there is no positive compulsion the
hand is only handmaid to the heart, and it does the
work only which the heart wishes. At this hour
Denas hated her knitting, and there being no necessity
on her to perform it, her hands lay idle upon
her lap. After a few minutes&rsquo; conversation John
went out with Tris Penrose, and then Denas began
to cry with anger and disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father has insulted me before Tris Penrose,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;and I will never speak to Tris again.
Many a time and oft he has let me go to St. Penfer
when it was raining and blowing. He is very cross,
cruel cross! Mother, you give me leave&ndash;&ndash;do! I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
will tell you a secret. Elizabeth is going to be married,
and she wants me to help in getting her things
ready. Mother, let me go; it is cruel hard to refuse
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news of an approaching marriage can never
be heard by any woman with indifference. Joan
stayed her needle and looked at Denas with an
eager curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to the rector, I&rsquo;ll warrant, Denas,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not; but the rector is fine and angry,
I can tell you. It was too much for him to speak
to Miss Tresham on Saturday afternoon at the
church. But won&rsquo;t he be sorry for his disknowledging
her when he knows who is to be the bridegroom?
He will, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, Denas. Who is going
to marry Miss Tresham? Say the man&rsquo;s name, and
be done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a great secret, mother; but if you will let
me go to St. Penfer I will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear, I can live without Miss Tresham&rsquo;s
secrets. And I do know she can&rsquo;t be having one I
would go against your father to hear tell of, not I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father is unjust and unkind. What have I done,
mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is afraid of that young jackanapes,
Roland Tresham, and good reason, too, if all be
true that is said to be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Roland is a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentleman and gentleman&ndash;&ndash;there be many kinds,
and no kind at all for you. You be a fisher&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
daughter, and you must choose a husband of your
own sort&ndash;&ndash;none better, thank God! The robin would
go to the eagle&rsquo;s nest, and a poor sad time it had
there. Gentlemen marry gentlemen&rsquo;s daughters,
Denas, and if they don&rsquo;t, all sides do be sorry
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to go no more to Miss Tresham&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until the young man is back in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish he would hurry all and be off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, my dear. I would be glad to hear that
he was far away from St. Penfer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan rose with these words and went out of the
room, and Denas knew that for this day also there
was no hope of seeing Roland. Her heart was hot
with anger, and she began to lay some of the blame
upon her lover. He was a man. He could have
braved the storm. And there was no open quarrel
between her father and himself; it would have been
easy enough to make an excuse for calling. Elizabeth
might have written a letter to her. Roland
might have brought it. Sitting there, she could
think of half-a-dozen things which Roland might
have accomplished. How long the hours were!
How would she ever get the days over? Her mother
singing in the curing-shed made her angry. The
ticking of the big clock accentuated her nervous
irritability, and when John returned silent and with
that air about him which indicated the master of
the house, Denas felt surely that all was over for
the present between her and Roland Tresham.</p>
<p>The night became blustery after John and the men
had gone to the fishing, and by midnight there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
a storm. Joan&rsquo;s white, anxious face was peering
through the windows or out of the open door into
the black night continually. And the presence of
Denas did not comfort her, as it usually did; the
mother felt that her child&rsquo;s thoughts were with
strangers, and not with her father out on the stormy
sea.</p>
<p>It was ten o&rsquo;clock next morning before John got
home. He had made a little harbour some miles
off, and glad to make it, and had been compelled
to lay there until daybreak. He was weary and
silent. He said it would have gone hard with him
had not Tris been at his right hand. Then he
looked anxiously at Denas, and when she did not
give him a smile or a word, he sat down by the fire
much depressed and exhausted. For he saw that
his child had a hard, angry heart toward him, and
he felt how useless it was to try and explain or
justify his dealings with her.</p>
<p>It was now Wednesday, and Denas burned with
shame when she thought how readily she had listened
to so careless a lover. No word of any kind
came from Elizabeth, who indeed was not to blame
under the circumstances. Mr. Burrell was much
with her; they had a hundred delightful arrangements
to make about their marriage and their future
housekeeping. And if in these days Elizabeth was
a little proud and important and very much interested
in her own affairs, she was innocently so. She
was only exhibiting the natural parade of a lovely
bud spreading itself into a perfect flower.</p>
<p>She had not the slightest intention of being unkind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
to Denas; indeed, she looked forward to many pleasant
hours with her and to her assistance in all the
preparations for her marriage. And Roland had introduced
the subject quite as frequently as he felt
it to be prudent. Finally Elizabeth had plainly
told him that she did not intend to have Denas
with her until he returned to London. &ldquo;I see you
so seldom, Roland,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and we will not have
any stranger intermeddling when you are at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Elizabeth,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you are putting
up your disapprovals in the shape of compliments.
My dear, you are afraid I will fall in love with
Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you will make love to her, which is
a very different thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want Denas here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to have her here. I have a great
deal of sewing to do, and she is a perfect and rapid
needlewoman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go to-morrow and ask her to come. I am
off to London to-night. In this world no one has
pleasure but he who gives himself some. You were
my only pleasure at St. Penfer, and I do not care to
share your society with Robert Burrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go and see Denas. I must ask her parents
to let her stay with me until my marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But as Denas did not know of this intention, that
weary Wednesday dragged itself away amid rain
and storm and household dissatisfaction; but by
Thursday morning the elements had blustered their
passion away and the world was clear-skied and
sunshiny. Not so Denas; she sat in a dark corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
of the room, cross and silent, and answering her
father and mother only in monosyllables. John&rsquo;s
heart was greatly troubled by her attitude. He
stood leaning against the lintel of the door, watching
his boat rocking upon the tide, for he was thinking
that until Denas and he were &ldquo;in&rdquo; again he had
better stop at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do leave my heart at home, and then I do lose
my head at sea;&rdquo; and with this unsatisfactory
thought John turned to his daughter and said softly:
&ldquo;Denas, my dear, &rsquo;tis a bright day. Will you
have a walk? But there&ndash;&ndash;here be Miss Tresham, I
do know it is her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas rose quickly and looked a moment at the
tall, handsome girl picking her way across the pebbly
path. Then she threw down her knitting and went
to meet her, and Elizabeth was pleased and flattered
by her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e&rsquo;s complaints and welcomes. &ldquo;I
thought you would never send me a message or a
letter,&rdquo; almost sobbed Denas. &ldquo;I never hoped you
would come. O Elizabeth, how I have longed to
see you! Life is so stupid when I cannot come to
your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father was afraid of your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was right, Denas. Roland is too gay and
thoughtless a young man to be about a pretty girl
like you. But he has gone to London, and I do not
think he will come back here until near the wedding-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they were at the door, and John Penelles
welcomed the lady with all the native grace that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
springs from a kind heart and from noble instincts
which have become principles. &ldquo;You be right welcome,
Miss Tresham,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My little maid has
fret more than she should have done for you. I do
say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also missed Denas very much. I have no
sister, Mr. Penelles, and Denas has been something
like one to me. I am come to ask you if she may
stay with me until my marriage in June. No one
can sew like Denas, and now I can afford to pay her
a good deal of money for her work&ndash;&ndash;for her love
I give her love. No gold pays for love, does it,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John was pleased with her frankness. He knew
the value of money, he knew also the moral value
of letting Denas earn money. He answered with a
candour which brushed away all pretences:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We be all obliged to you, Miss Tresham. We
be all glad that Denas should make money so
happily. It will help her own wedding and furnishing,
whenever God do send her a good man to love
her. It be a great honour to Denas to have your
love, but there then! your brother is a fine, handsome
young man, and&ndash;&ndash;no offence, miss&ndash;&ndash;it would
not be a great honour for my little maid to have his
love or the likelihood of it&ndash;&ndash;and out of temptation
is out of danger, miss, and if so be I do speak plain
and bluff, you will not put it down against me, I&rsquo;ll
warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Mr. Penelles, that you are quite right.
I have felt all you say for two years, and have
shielded the honour and the happiness of Denas as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
if she was in very deed my sister. Can you not
trust her with me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a great charge, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to take it. I will keep it for you
faithfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis too much to ask, miss; &rsquo;twould be a constant
charge, for wrong-doing is often a matter of a
few moments, though the repentance for it may last
a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland is in London. He went yesterday. I
do not expect him to come to St. Penfer again until
the wedding. I assure you of this, Mr. Penelles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then your word for it, Miss Tresham. Take
my little maid with you. She be my life, miss. If
Denas was hurt any way &rsquo;twould be like I got a
shot in my backbone; &rsquo;twould be as bad for her
mother, likewise for poor Tris Penrose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth smiled. &ldquo;I am glad to hear there is a
lover; Denas never told me of him. Is he good
and brave, and handsome and young, and well-to-do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He be all these, and more too; for he do love
the ground Denas treads on&ndash;&ndash;he do for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas was in her room putting on her blue merino
and her hat, and while she made her small arrangements
and talked to her mother, Elizabeth set herself
to win the entire confidence of John Penelles.
It was not a hard thing to do. Evil and sin had to
be present and palpable for John&rsquo;s honest heart to
realize them. And Miss Tresham&rsquo;s open face, her
frank assurances, her straightforward understanding
of the position were a pledge John never doubted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>Certainly Elizabeth meant all she promised. She
was as desirous to prevent any love-making as John
Penelles was. And when interest and conscience are
in the same mind, people do at least try to keep
their promises. Denas went gayly back with her to
St. Penfer. It was something to be in Roland&rsquo;s
home; she would hear him spoken of, and she would
exchange the monotonous common duties of her own
home for the happy bustle and the festive preparations
of a house where a fine wedding was to be celebrated.</p>
<p>Her expectations in this respect were more than
gratified. Every hour of the day brought something
to discuss, to exclaim over, to wonder about,
to select, to try on. Notes and flowers, and sweetmeats,
and presents of all kinds were continually
reminding Elizabeth of her lover; and she grew
beautiful and generous in the sunshine of such a magnificent
love. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday passed
like a happy dream. On Saturday evening Denas
was to return home until after the Sabbath. For
Saturday night and Sunday were John&rsquo;s holiday,
and a poor one indeed it would be to him without
his daughter. Nor was Denas averse to go home.
She looked forward to the pleasure of telling her
mother everything she had seen and done; she
looked forward to going to chapel with her father,
and showing a pretty hat and collar and a pair of
kid gloves which Elizabeth had given her.</p>
<p>About five o&rsquo;clock she started down the cliff.
Her heart was light in spite of Roland&rsquo;s silence.
Indeed, she had begun to feel a contempt for him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
and greater contempt for herself because she had for
a moment believed in a man so light of love and
so false of heart. Elizabeth&rsquo;s affairs were full of
interest to her. Elizabeth had been so sisterly and
kind. She had paid her well and promised her
many things that made life seem full of hope to the
ambitious fisher-girl. How the birds did sing!
How still the green glades were! In that one week
of rain and sunshine, how the leaves had grown!</p>
<p>She went gayly forward, humming softly to herself&ndash;&ndash;none
of the songs Roland sang with her, but a
little love-song Elizabeth had learned from Robert
Burrell. Her foot had that spring to its lift and
fall that shows there is a young innocent heart
above it. In and out among the glades she went,
almost as brightly and musically as the brook
whose sparkling and darkling course she followed.
When but a few hundred yards down the path,
someone called her. She thought it was a fancy
and went onward, nevertheless feeling a sudden
silence and trouble. Immediately she heard footsteps
and the rustling swish of parting leaves and
branches.</p>
<p>Then she stood still and looked toward the
place of disturbance. A moment afterward Roland
Tresham was at her side. He took her hand; he
said softly, &ldquo;This way, darling!&rdquo; and before she
could make the slightest resistance he had drawn
her into a little glade shut in by large boulders and
lofty trees. Then he had his arms around her, and
was laughing and talking a thousand sweet, unreasonable
things.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Tresham, let me go! Let me go!&rdquo; cried
Denas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while you say &lsquo;Mr. Tresham.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Roland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, love, Roland. Say it a thousand times.
Did you think I had forgotten you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruel to be kind, Denas. My love! they think
I am in London. Everyone thinks so. I did go to
London last Wednesday. I left London this morning
very early. I got off the train at St. Claire and
walked across the cliff, and found out this pretty
hiding-place. And I am going to be here every
Saturday night&ndash;&ndash;every Saturday night, wet or fine,
and if you do not come here to see me, I will go to
Australia and never see St. Penfer again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would talk nothing but the most extravagant
nonsense, and finally Denas believed him. He gave
her a ring that looked very like Elizabeth&rsquo;s betrothal
ring, and was even larger than Elizabeth&rsquo;s, and he
told her to wear it in her breast until she could
wear it on her hand. And for this night, and for
many other Saturday nights, he never named the plot
in his shallow head and selfish heart; he devoted
himself to winning completely the girl&rsquo;s absorbing
love&ndash;&ndash;not a very difficult thing to do, for the air of romance
and mystery, at once so charming and so dangerous,
enthralled her fancy; his eager, masterful,
caressing wooing made her tremble with a delicious
fear and hope; and in the week&rsquo;s silence and dreaming,
the folly of every meeting grew marvellously.</p>
<p>Nor was the loving, ignorant girl unaffected by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
the apparently rich gifts her lover brought her&ndash;&ndash;brooch
and locket and bracelet, many bright and
sparkling ornaments, which poor Denas hid away
with joy and almost childish delight and prideful
expectations. And if her conscience troubled
her, she assured it that &ldquo;if it was right for Elizabeth
to receive such offerings of affection, it could
not be wrong for her to do likewise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alas! alas! She did not remember that the element
of secrecy made the element of sin. If she
had only entertained this thought, it would have
made her understand that the meeting which cannot
be known and the gift which cannot be shown
are wicked in their essence and their influence, and
are incapable of bringing forth anything but sorrow
and sin.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">All</span> fashionable wedding ceremonies are similar
in kind and effect, and Elizabeth would not
have been satisfied if hers had varied greatly from
the highest normal standard. Her dress was of the
most exquisite ivory-white satin and Honiton lace.
Her bridesmaids wore the orthodox pink and blue
of palest shades. There was the usual elaborate
breakfast; the cake and favours, the flowers and
music, and the finely dressed company filling the
old rooms with subdued laughter and conversation.
All things were managed with that consummate
taste and order which money without stint can
always command; and Elizabeth felt that she had
inaugurated a standard of perfection which cast all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
previous affairs into oblivion, and demanded too much
for any future one to easily attain unto.</p>
<p>In the arrangements for this completely satisfactory
function, the position which Denas was to
occupy caused some discussion. Mr. Tresham had
hitherto regarded her with an indifference which
sometimes assumed a character of irritability. He
was occasionally jealous of his daughter&rsquo;s liking for
the girl; he knew men, and he was always suspicious
of her influence on his son Roland. Proud and
touchy about his own social position, he never forgot
that Denas was the child of poor fisher people,
and he could not understand the tolerant affection
Elizabeth gave to a girl so far beneath her own
standing.</p>
<p>When Elizabeth included her in the list of bridesmaids,
he disputed the choice with considerable
temper. He said that he had long endured a
companionship not at all to his taste, because it
gave Elizabeth pleasure; but that on no account
would he compel his guests to receive Denas as
their equal. His opposition was so determined
that Elizabeth gave up her intention, though she
had to break an oft-repeated promise. But, then,
promises must be dependent on circumstances for
their redemption, and all the circumstances were
against Denas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burrell has two sisters,&rdquo; said Elizabeth to
her, &ldquo;and if I do not ask Cousin Flora I shall
never be forgiven; and father insists upon Georgia
Godolphin, because of his friendship with Squire
Godolphin; and I cannot manage more than four
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
bridesmaids, can I? So you see, Denas,&rdquo; etc.,
etc., etc.</p>
<p>Denas saw quite clearly, and with a certain pride
of self-respect she relegated herself to a position
that would interfere with no one&rsquo;s claims and
offend no one&rsquo;s social ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to be your real bridesmaid, Elizabeth,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Miss Burrells, and your cousin Flora, and
Miss Godolphin are for show. I shall be really
your maid. I shall lace your white satin boots, and
fasten your white satin dress, and drape the lace,
and clasp the gems, and make your bride-bouquet.
I shall stay upstairs while you are at church and
lay ready your travelling costume and see that
Ad&egrave;le packs your trunks properly; and when you go
away I shall fasten your cloak, and tie your bonnet,
and button your gloves, and then go away myself;
for there will be no one here then that likes me and
nothing at all for me to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this programme, made with a little heartache
and sense of love&rsquo;s failure, Denas faithfully carried
out. It cost her something to do it, but she did
not permit Elizabeth to see that she counted her
faithless in her heart. For she did not blame her
friend; she understood the force of the reasons not
given&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s latent dislike, her humble
birth, her want of fine clothes and fine polish and
rich connections&ndash;&ndash;and she felt keenly enough that
there was nothing about her, personally or socially,
to make Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s guests desire her.</p>
<p>And when the day drew near and they began to
arrive, Denas shrank more and more from their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
society. She saw that Elizabeth&rsquo;s manner with
them was quite different from her manner to herself,
and in spite of much kindness and generosity she
felt humiliated, alone, outside, and apart. She
wondered why it was. These rich girls came in
little companies to Elizabeth&rsquo;s room, and with soft
laughter and exclamations of delight examined the
bride&rsquo;s pretty garments and presents. They were
never haughty with her; on the contrary, they were
exceedingly pleasant. They called her &ldquo;Miss
Denas&rdquo; and carefully avoided anything like condescension
in their intercourse. Yet Denas knew
that between them and herself there was a line impalpable
as the equator and just as potent in its
dividing power.</p>
<p>It saddened her beyond reason, and when Roland
arrived two days before the wedding and she saw
him wandering in the garden, riding, driving, playing
tennis, chatting and chaffing, singing and dancing
with these four girls of his own circle, she divined
a difference, which she could not explain but which
pained and angered her.</p>
<p>Still, that last week of Elizabeth&rsquo;s maiden life was
a wonderful week. It was like living in the scenes
of a theatre&ndash;&ndash;there was no talk but of love. All
that everyone said or did referred to the great passion.
The house was in the hands of decorators;
the aroma of all kinds of delicious things to eat was
in the air. There was a constant tinkling of the
piano and harp. Snatches of song, ripples of
laughter, young voices calling through the house
and garden, light footsteps going everywhere, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
flutter of pink and blue and white dresses, the snowy
ribbons and massed roses in every room, the exciting
atmosphere of love and expectation&ndash;&ndash;who could
escape it? And who, when in the midst of it, was
able to prevent or to deny its influence?</p>
<p>Denas gave herself freely to the moment. The
presence of Roland made all things easy to her.
He contrived many an unseen meeting; her lips
never lost the sense of his stolen kisses; her hands
were constantly pink with the passing clasp or the
momentary pressure. No one could have supposed
he was planning anything, for he was continually
with someone or with all of the four bridesmaids;
yet there was not an hour in which he did not manage
to give Denas her part, though it were but an
upward glance at the open window where she sat
sewing, or a kiss flung backward to her; or a lifted
hat, or a rose left where she alone could find it; or
a little love-letter crushed into her hand in passing.</p>
<p>Such a week to stir a young heart to love&rsquo;s sweet
fever! It passed like a dream, and went finally
with the clashing of wedding-bells and the trampling
of horses carrying away the bride. Then the
guests followed one by one until the house was
lonely and deserted; and the servants began to
remove the remnants of the feast and to take down
the fading wreaths and roses.</p>
<p>Mr. Tresham took Roland with him to Burrell
Court. He seemed determined to keep his son by
his side, and the drive to Burrell was an effectual
way. No one thought of Denas. She had now no
place nor office in the house. But she remained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
until near sundown, for she trusted that Roland
would find out a way to meet her at their usual
trysting-place. And just when she had given him
up he came. Then he told her that he was going
to London in the morning, because his father had
suddenly resolved upon a short pleasure-trip, and
he had promised to go with him as far as Paris.
But he had provided for their correspondence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a man in St. Clair called Pyn, a boatman
living in the first cottage you come to, Denas,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I have given him money, and my letters
to you will go to him. Can you walk to St. Clair
for them?&rdquo; It was a foolish question; Roland knew
that Denas would walk twenty miles for a letter
from him. He then gave her some addressed envelopes
in which to enclose her letters to him. &ldquo;Pyn
will post them,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the handwriting will
deceive everyone. And I shall come back to you,
Denas, as soon as I can get away from my father;
and Pyn will bring a message to St. Penfer and let
you know, in some way, when I get home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These particulars being fully arranged and understood,
he talked to her of her own loveliness. He
told her she was more beautiful in her plain white
frock than the bride in her bride-robes. He said
all that lovers have said from the beginning of time;
all that lovers will say until time ends. Denas
believed him, believed every word, for the nature
of true love is to be without doubt or fear. And
Roland thought he loved her quite well enough for
their future life together. If she was to become a
public singer, it would not be wise for him to have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
too exclusive and jealous affection for her. Roland
had always been prudent for himself; he thought of
everything which might affect his own happiness.
This night, however, he gave up all for love. He
kept Denas by his side until the gloaming was quite
gone, and then he walked with her down to the very
shingle. They parted with tears and kisses and
murmured protestations of fidelity. And Denas
watched her lover until he reached the first bend in
the upward path. There he turned, and she stretched
out her arms to him, and Roland lifted his hat and
kissed his hand, and then vanished among the thick
trees.</p>
<p>The moon was just rising. She made the air silver,
and Denas could see the fishing-boats on the
horizon swimming in her quivering beams. She
knew, then, that her father was at sea. As she
approached the cottage she saw her mother sitting
on the door-step. Her arms were folded across her
knees, she stooped forward, she had an air of discontent
or anxiety. There was also a dumb feeling
of resentment in her heart, though she did not
actually know that there was reason for it. She
tried to meet her child pleasantly, but could not,
and she was almost angry at the stubborn indifference
which she was unable to conquer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be long in getting home, Denas. Father
went to sea quite put out. Jane Serlo says the
bride did go away at two o&rsquo;clock. Well, then, it be
long after nine now, Denas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a lot to do after Mrs. Burrell left, mother&ndash;&ndash;things
she would not trust anyone else to look to.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hum-m! &rsquo;Tis no good way, to take such charge.
Who knows what she may be saying after-times? I
do feel glad she be married at last, and done with.
Mayhap we may see a bit of comfort ourselves now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave me twenty pounds before she left,
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be things twenty pound can&rsquo;t buy nor pay
for; I tell you that, Denas. And to see your father
go off with the boat to-night, without heart in him
and only care for company! I do not feel to like
it, Denas. If your lover be dear to you, so be my
old husband to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What lover are you talking about, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lover that kept you on the cliff-breast&ndash;&ndash;Roland
Tresham, he be the lover I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you I was with Roland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you were not at Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s, for
one called there to put you safely home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Tris Penrose has been spying me and
telling tales to father and you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be no need for Tris nor for anyone else
to speak. Say to me, plain and straight, that you
were not with Roland Tresham to-night. Say that
to me, if you dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had such a happy day, mother, and now
you have taken all the pleasure out of it&ndash;&ndash;a mean
thing to do! I say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father and I had a happy day, thinking of
your happiness. And then to please that bad young
man, who is not of your kind and not of your kin,
you do stay out till bad birds and night creatures
are prowling; till the dew be wetting you; till you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
have sent your father off to the deep sea with a
heart heavy enough to sink his boat&ndash;&ndash;a mean thing
that to do! Yes! yes! cruel mean thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burrell gave me twenty pounds. I had to
do something to earn it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith! I&rsquo;d fling the twenty pound to the
fishes. Aw, then, &rsquo;tis a poor price for my girl&rsquo;s
love, and her innocent heart, and the proud content
she once had in her own folk. Only fishers! but
God&rsquo;s folk, for all that! But there! What be the
use of talking? After Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s flim-flams,
my words be only muddling folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to bed, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. Go your ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan also rose, and went to the fireside, and
drew the few coals together, and lit a lamp. For
a moment she stood still, looking at the closed door
between her and her child; then she lifted a large
book from the window-sill, laid it on the small
round table, opened it wide, and sat down before
it. It was a homely, workaday-looking book, and
she did not read a word of it, though her eyes were
upon the page. But it was the Bible. And the
Bible is like the sunshine, it comforts and cheers
us only to sit down in its presence.</p>
<p>And very soon Joan lifted her hand and laid it
across the open page. It was like taking the hand
of a friend. God knows what strength, what virtue,
there was in that movement! For she immediately
covered her face with her other hand and tears
began to fall, and anon mighty whispered words
parted her lips&ndash;&ndash;words that went from the mother&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
heart to the heart of God! How can such prayer
ever fail?</p>
<p>In the morning John Penelles met his daughter,
not with the petulant anger of a wounded woman,
but with a graver and more reasonable reproof.
&ldquo;Denas, my dear,&rdquo; he said, and he gently stroked
her hair as he spoke, &ldquo;Denas, you didn&rsquo;t do right
yesterday; did you now? But you do be sorry for
it, I see; so let the trouble go. But no more of
it! No more out in the dark, my girl, either for
bride-making or for corpse-waking, and as for the
man who kept you out, let him ask God to keep him
from under my hand. That is all about it. Come
and give father his tea, and then we will mend the
nets together; and if Saturday be fair, Denas, we
will go to St. Merryn and see your Aunt Agnes.
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go?&rsquo; Aw, yes, my dear, you do
want to go. You be vexed now; and not you that
should be vexed at all, but your mother and I.
There, then! No more of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke the last words as if he was at the end of
his patience, and then turned sharply toward the
broiled fish and hot tea which Joan was placing on
the table. The face of Denas angered him, it was
so indifferent and so wretched. He could have
laughed away a little temper and excused it, for he
was not an unjust nor even an unsympathetic man;
and he realized his daughter&rsquo;s youth and her natural
craving for those things which youth considers
desirable.</p>
<p>But the utter hopelessness of her attitude, her
refusal to eat, her silence, her sighs, the unsuitableness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
of the dress she wore to the humble duties of
her station, her disinclination to talk of what
troubled her, or indeed to talk at all&ndash;&ndash;both John
and Joan felt these things to be a wrong, deliberate
and perpetual, against their love and their home
and their daily happiness.</p>
<p>It was certainly a great and sudden change in the
life of Denas. For the past eight weeks she had
been in an atmosphere of excitement, tinctured with
the subtle hopes and expectations of love. In it
she had grown mentally far beyond the realization
of her friends. She had observed, assimilated, and
translated her new ideas through her own personality
as far as her means permitted. If her mother
and father had looked carefully at their daughter,
they would have seen how much more effectively
her hair was arranged; what piquancy of mode had
been observed in the making of her new dresses; what
careful pride had dictated the fashion and fit of her
high-heeled shoes; what trouble was systematically
taken to preserve her delicate skin and to restore
the natural beauty of her hands&ndash;&ndash;in short, they must
have noticed that their child&rsquo;s toilet and general
appearance was being gradually but still rapidly
removed from all fitness with her present surroundings.</p>
<p>And just after Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriage came on the
hardest and most distinctive part of the fisher&rsquo;s year.
All along the rocky coast the &ldquo;huers&rdquo; were standing
watching for the shoals of pilchard, and the men
were in the boats beneath, waiting for their signal
to shoot the seines. Every fisher had now, in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
intense degree, the look which always distinguishes
him&ndash;&ndash;the look of a man accustomed to reflect and
to be ready for emergencies. This year the shoals
were so large that boat-loads were caught easily in
fifty feet of water.</p>
<p>Then every wife in the hamlet had her hands full
and busy from dawn till dark; and Joan went to
the work with an exuberant alacrity and good nature.
In former years Denas had felt all the enthusiasm
of the great sea harvest. This year she could
not endure its clamour and its labour. What had
happened to her that the sight of the beautiful fish
was offensive and the smell of its curing intolerable?
She shut her eyes from the silvery heaps and
would gladly have closed her ears against the jubilant
mirth, the shouting and laughing and singing
around her.</p>
<p>Her intense repugnance did really at last breed
in her a low fever, which she almost gladly succumbed
to. She thought it easier to lie in bed and
suffer in solitude than to put her arms to her white
elbows in fresh fish and bear the familiar jokes of the
busy, merry workers in the curing-sheds. Denas
was not really responsible for this change. It had
grown into her nature, day by day and week by
week, while she was unconscious of any transforming
power. The little reluctances which had marked
its first appearance had been of small note; her
father and mother had only laughingly reproved
them, telling her &ldquo;not to nourish prideful notions.&rdquo;
She had not even been aware of nourishing anything
wrong. Was it wrong? She lay tossing on her bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
in the small warm room, and argued the question
out while fever burned in her veins and gave to all
things abnormal and extravagant aspects.</p>
<p>She was really ill, and she almost wished she
could be more ill. No one quite believed she was
suffering much. The headache and languor incident
to her condition did not win much sympathy
until their ravages became apparent. Then Joan
honestly believed that a little exercise in the fresh
salt air would have cured, perhaps even prevented,
the illness. So that at this time Denas thought
herself very unkindly used.</p>
<p>This apparent lack of interest in her condition
added greatly to that dissatisfaction with her life
which she now constantly dwelt upon. She felt that
she must do something to escape from an existence
which repelled her; and yet what could she do?
Somehow she had suddenly lost faith in Elizabeth.
Elizabeth changed before she went away; who could
say how much greater the change would be when
she returned after four months&rsquo; travel?</p>
<p>Denas at this time pitied herself greatly, and taking
women as they are, and not as they ought to be,
she deserved some pity. For though it may not be
a lofty ambition to long after a finely appointed
house, and delicate food delicately served, and
elegant clothing and refined society, and, with all
and above all, a lover who fits into such externals,
yet Denas did long for these things; and the circumstances
of her own life were common, and vulgar,
and hateful to her.</p>
<p>True, she had her father and mother, and she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
loved them dearly; but, then, she could undoubtedly
love them quite as well if she were rich, while they
would not love her any the less. As for Tris Penrose
and his tiresome devotion, what was Tris to
Roland? Tris did not even know how to woo her.
He never told her how beautiful she was, and how
he adored her, and longed for her, and thought all
women wearisome but her. He never kissed her
hands and her hair, her cheeks and her lips, as
Roland did. He never said to her, &ldquo;You are fit to
be a duchess or a queen; you sing like a nightingale
and charm my soul out of me, and you have hands
and feet like a fairy.&rdquo; Poor Tris! He was stupid
and silent. He could only look and sigh, or, if he
did manage to speak, he was sure to plunge into
such final questions as, &ldquo;Denas, will you marry me?
When will you marry me?&rdquo; Or to tell her of his
stone cottage, and his fine boat, and the money he
had in the St. Merryn&rsquo;s Savings Bank.</p>
<p>For three weeks this silent conflict went on in the
mind and heart of Denas, an unsatisfactory fight in
which no victory was gained. At the end she was
no more mistress of her inclinations than at the
beginning, and her returning health only intensified
her longings for the things she had not. One morning
she awoke with the conviction that there was a
letter for her at St. Clair. She determined to go
and see. She said to her mother that she felt almost
well and would try to take a walk. And Joan was
glad and encouraged the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go down to the sea-shore, Denas, and breathe
the living air; do, my sweetheart!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, mother. There are crowds there and the
smell of fish, and&ndash;&ndash;I can&rsquo;t help it, mother&ndash;&ndash;it turns
me sick; it makes me feverish. I want to go among
the trees and flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear, you will be climbing and climbing
up to St. Penfer; and you be weak yet and not
able to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not climb at all. I will walk near the
shingle; and I will take a bit of bread with me
and a drink of milk; then I can rest all day on the
grass, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, dear! And see now, come home
while the sun is warm&ndash;&ndash;and take care of yourself,
Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan went to the curing-sheds. She had a
light heart, for Denas was more like her old self,
and after going a hundred yards she turned to nod
to her girl, and was glad that she was watching her
and that she waved her kerchief in reply. Something
heavy slipped from Joan&rsquo;s heart at that moment
and her work went with her all day long.</p>
<p>It was two miles to St. Clair, but Denas walked
there very rapidly. She remembered that Pyn&rsquo;s cottage
was the first cottage; and as she approached it
the boatman came to the door. He looked at her
with a grave curiosity, and she went straight up to
him and said: &ldquo;Have you a letter for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think I have. You be John Penelles&rsquo; little
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew John years ago. We sat in the same
boat. I like John&ndash;&ndash;he is a true man. Here be three
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
letters. At first I thought these letters be going
to bring a deal of potter and bother&ndash;&ndash;maybe something
worse&ndash;&ndash;and I will put them in the fire. Then
I thought, they bean&rsquo;t your letters, Pyn, and if you
want to keep yourself out of a mess, never interfere
and never volunteer. So here they be. But if you
will take an old man&rsquo;s advice, I do say to you, burn
the letters. It will be better far than to be reading
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why will it be better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be letters worse than death drugs. If
you do buy a bottle of arsenic, the man will put its
character on the bottle. You see &lsquo;poison&rsquo; and you
be warned. But young men do write poison, and
worse than poison, to young women, and no warning
outside the letter. It isn&rsquo;t fair, now, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you take charge of the poison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure! Why did I? Just because it was
for John Penelles&rsquo; little girl, and I thought mayhap
she&rsquo;d take a warning from me. Don&rsquo;t you read
them letters, my dear. If you do, let the words go
in at one ear and out of the other. Roland Tresham!
he be nothing to trust to! Aw, my dear&ndash;&ndash;a leaky
boat&ndash;&ndash;a boat adrift; no man at the helm; no helm
to man; no sail; no compass; no anchor; no anything
for a woman to trust to! There, then, I have
had my say; if this say be of no &rsquo;count, twould
be the same if I talked my tongue away. If you
come again and there be any letters, you will find
them under the turned boat&ndash;&ndash;slip your hand in&ndash;&ndash;so.
Dear me! You be fluttering and wuttering like a
bird. Poor dear! Step into my boat and I&rsquo;ll put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
you back home. You look as quailed as a faded
flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Pyn talked as he helped Denas into the boat
and slowly settled himself to the oars. Afterward
he said nothing, but he looked at Denas in a way
that troubled her and made her thankful to escape
his silent, pitiful condemnation. Her mother was
still absent when she reached the cottage, and she
was so weary that she was very grateful for the solitude.
She shut her eyes for a few minutes and collected
her strength, and then opened Roland&rsquo;s letters.</p>
<p>They were full of happiness&ndash;&ndash;full of wonders&ndash;&ndash;full
of love. He was going to Switzerland with his
father. Elizabeth was there, and Miss Caroline
Burrell, and a great many people whom they knew.
But for him, no one was there. &ldquo;Denas was all he
longed for, cared for, lived for!&rdquo; Oh, much more
of the same kind, for Roland&rsquo;s love lay at the point
of his pen.</p>
<p>And he told her also that he had heard many
singers, many famous singers, and none with a
voice so wildly sweet, so enthralling as her voice.
&ldquo;If you were only on the stage, Denas,&rdquo; he wrote,
&ldquo;you could sing the world to your feet; you could
make a great fortune; you could do anything you
liked to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words entered her heart. They burned along
her veins, they filled her imagination with a thousand
wild dreams. She put the fatal letters safely
away, and then, stretching her weary form upon her
bed, she closed her eyes and began to think.</p>
<p>Why should she cure fish, and mend nets, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
clean tables and tea-cups, if she possessed such a
marvellous gift? Why should her father go fishing
with his life in his hand, and her mother work hard
from dawn to dark, and she herself want all the
beautiful things her soul craved? And how would
Elizabeth feel? Perhaps they might be glad enough
yet if she married Roland. And as the possibility
of returning social slights presented itself, she remembered
many a debt of this kind it would be a
joy to satisfy. And then Roland! Roland! Roland!
He had always believed in her; always loved her.
She would repay his trust and love a thousand-fold.
What a joy it would be!</p>
<p>So she permitted herself to grasp impossibilities,
to possess everything she desired. Well, in this
life, what mortals know is but very little; what
they imagine&ndash;&ndash;ah, that is everything!</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Hope</span> has a long reach, and yet it holds fast.
So, though Roland&rsquo;s return was far enough
away, Denas possessed it in anticipation. The belief
that he would come, that he would give her
sympathy and assistance, helped her through the
long sameness of uneventful days by the witching
promise, &ldquo;Anon&ndash;&ndash;anon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little to vary life in that quiet hamlet.
The pilchard season went, as it had come, in a
day; men counted their gains and returned to their
usual life. Denas tried to accept it cheerfully; she
felt that it would soon be a past life, and this conviction
helped her to invest it with some of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
tender charm which clings to whatever enters the
pathetic realm of &ldquo;Nevermore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her parents were singularly kind to her, and John
tried to give a little excitement to her life by coaxing
her to share with him the things he considered
quite stirring. But visits to her aunt at St. Merryn,
and Sunday trips to hear some new preacher, and
choir practisings with Tris dangling after them
wherever they went, were not interesting to the
wayward girl. She only endured them, as she endured
her daily duties by keeping steadily in view
the hope Roland had set before her. However, as
she sang nearly constantly, Joan&rsquo;s mind was easy;
she was sure Denas could not be very discontented,
for it never entered Joan&rsquo;s thought that people
could sing unless there was melody in their heart.
And undoubtedly Denas was cheered by her own
music, for if song is given half a chance it has the
miraculous power of turning the water of life into
wine.</p>
<p>Only two more letters repaid her for many walks
to the turned boat, and she did not see Pyn again.
She was sure, however, that he knew of her visits
and wilfully avoided her. The last of these letters
contained the startling intelligence of Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s
death. He had foolishly insisted upon visiting
Rome in the unhealthy season and had fallen
a victim to fever. Roland wrote in a very depressed
mood. He said that his father&rsquo;s death
would make a great difference to him. In a short
time the news arrived by the regular sources. Lawyer
Tremaine had been advised to take charge of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s personal estate, and the newspaper
of the district had a long obituary of the deceased
gentleman.</p>
<p>John said very little on the subject. He had not
liked Mr. Tresham while living, but he was particularly
careful to avoid speaking ill of the dead.
He said only that he had heard that &ldquo;the effects left
would barely cover outstanding debts, and that Mr.
Tresham&rsquo;s income died with him. &rsquo;Tis a good
thing Miss Tresham be well married,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;else &rsquo;twould have been whist hard times for her
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas did not answer. Her sudden and apparently
unreasonable indifference to her former friend
was one of the many mental changes which she could
not account for. But she waited impatiently for
some word about Roland. John appeared to have
nothing to say. Joan hesitated with the question
on her lips, and at last she almost threw it at her
husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you hear about young Mr. Tresham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked no questions about him. People do say
that he will have to go to honest work now. &rsquo;Twill
do him no harm, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest work will be nothing strange to him,
father. He has been in a great many offices. I
have heard Elizabeth speaking of many a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant&ndash;&ndash;many a one&ndash;&ndash;and he never stays
in any. He has a bad temper for work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad temper! That is not true. Mr. Roland
has a very good temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good temper! To be sure, after a fashion, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
kind of <i>Hy-to-everybody</i> fashion. But a good business
temper, Denas, be a different thing; it be
steady, patient, civil, quiet, hard-to-work temper,
and the young man has not got it. No, nor the
shadow of it. If he was worth thousands this year
he wouldn&rsquo;t have a farthing next year unless he had
a guider and a withholder by his side constantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to speak of Mr. Roland at all,
father, you hate him that badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you be, Denas. I ought not to speak of
the young man. I will let him alone. And I&rsquo;ll
thank every one in my house to do the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some weeks John&rsquo;s orders were carefully observed.
Denas got no more letters, and the summer
weather became autumn weather; and then the
leaves faded and began to fall, and the equinoctial
storm set the seal of advancing winter on the cliff-breast.
Yet through all these changes the clock
ticked the monotonous days surely away, and one
morning when Denas was standing alone in the cottage
door a little lad slipped up and put a letter
into her hand.</p>
<p>He was gone in a moment, and Denas, even while
answering a remark of her mother&rsquo;s, who was busy
at the fireside, hid the message in her bosom. Of
course it was from Roland. He said that they had
all returned to Burrell Court and that he could not
rest until he had seen her. Wet or fine, he begged
she would be at their old trysting-place that evening.</p>
<p>Then she began to consider how this was to be
managed, and she came to the conclusion that a
visit to St. Penfer was the best way. She knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
well how to prepare for it&ndash;&ndash;the little helps, and confidences,
and personal chatter Joan was always
pleased and flattered by were the wedge. Then as
they washed the dinner dishes and tidied the house
together, Denas said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, it is going to storm soon, and then
whole days to sit and sew and nothing to talk
about. Priscilla Mohun promised me some pretty
pieces for my quilt, and Priscilla always knows
everything that is going on. What do you think?
Shall I go there this afternoon? I could get the
patches and hear the news and bring back a story
paper, and so be home before you would have time
to miss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, we do feel to be talked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla will tell me all there is to hear, and if
I get the patches, a few days&rsquo; sewing and the quilt
will be ready for you to cross-stitch; and a story
paper is such a comfort when the storm is beating
you back to house every hour of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say right&ndash;&ndash;it be a great comfort. But you
will have to be busy all, for it is like enough to
rain within an hour&ndash;&ndash;the tide will bring it, I&rsquo;ll
warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will wear my waterproof. Mother, dear, I do
want a little change so much&ndash;&ndash;just to see some new
faces and hear tell of the St. Penfer people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, go your way, Denas, a wetting will
do you no harm; and I do know the days be long
days, and the nights do never seem to come to midnight
and then wear to cock-crow. &rsquo;Twould be a
whist poor life, my dear, if this life were all.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>Denas was now very anxious to get off before her
father came back from his afternoon gossip at the
boats. With a gay heart she left her home and
hastened to St. Penfer to execute the things that
had been her ostensible reason for the visit. As it
happened, Priscilla Mohun was full of news. The
first thing she said to Denas related to the return of
the Burrells, and then followed all the gossip about
the treasures they had brought with them and
changes to be made in the domestic life of the
Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burrell be going to turn things upside
down, I can tell you, Denas. They do say four
new servants are hired, two men and two women;
and the horses brought down are past talking about,
with silver trimmings on their harness&ndash;&ndash;that, and
no less&ndash;&ndash;and carriages of all kinds, and one kind
finer than the other! I do suppose Mrs. Burrell&rsquo;s
gowns will be all London or Paris bought now;
though to be sure poor Priscilla did make her wedding-dress&ndash;&ndash;but
there, then! what be the use of
talking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have they been at home?&rdquo; asked
Denas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;La! I thought if anybody knew that it would
be you. I was just taking a walk last Wednesday,
and I happened to see them driving through the
town; Mr. Burrell and his sister, and Mrs. Burrell
and her handsome brother&ndash;&ndash;how happy they looked,
and everyone lifting their hats or making a respectful
move to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last Wednesday! and it was now Monday.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
Denas was dashed by the news. But she chattered
away about everyone they knew, and got her
patches, and her story paper, and then, just as the
gloaming was losing itself in the fog from the sea,
she started down the cliff. Roland was waiting for
her. He took her in his arms and kissed her with
an eager and delighted affection; and though the
fog had changed to a soft rain, neither of them appeared
to be uncomfortably aware of the fact.
Denas drew the hood of her waterproof over her
head and Roland the heavy collar of his coat about
his ears, and they sat close together on the damp
rock, with Roland&rsquo;s umbrella over them.</p>
<p>There was so much to say that they really said
nothing. When they had but half finished repeating
&ldquo;Sweet Denas!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dear Roland!&rdquo; Denas
had to go. It was only then she found courage to
intimate, in a half-frightened way, that she had been
thinking and wondering about her voice, and if she
really could learn to sing. Roland flushed with
delight to find the seed he had sown with so much
doubt grown up to strength and ripeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lovely one!&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you must go
to London and have lessons; and I will take care of
you. I will see that you have justice and that no
one hurts you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where could I live? And how? I have
one hundred pounds of my own. Will that be
enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little capitalist! How did you get a hundred
pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father has put a few pounds in the bank at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
St. Merryn every year since I was born for me,
and I have put there all the money your sister paid
me. Father said it was to furnish my home when
I got married, but I would rather spend it on my
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think so. Well, Beauty, you are to
come and see Elizabeth off Wednesday; then I shall
have something sweet and wonderful to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will Elizabeth send for me? That would make
it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think Elizabeth will send for you. I
have been hoping for that. She has not named you
at all. For my sake, come to the Court on Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long way to walk, but for your sake I
will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they parted, and she hastened back and
reached home just as John and Joan were beginning
to be uneasy at her delay. The sight of her happy
face, the charming little fuss she made about her
dripping waterproof and her wet shoes, the perfectly
winning way in which she took possession of her
father&rsquo;s knee and from it warmed her bare rosy
feet at the blaze scattered all shadows. She took
their fears and nascent anger by storm; she exhibited
her many-coloured bits of cloth, and showed
John the pictures in the story paper, and coaxingly
begged her mother for a cup of tea, because she
was cold and hungry. And then, as Joan made the
tea and the toast, Denas related all that Priscilla
had told her. And Joan wondered and exclaimed,
and John listened with a pleased interest, though he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
thought it right to say a word about speaking ill
of people, and was snubbed by Joan for doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burrell is putting on grand airs, it seems,
so then it will go that people of course will speak
ill of her,&rdquo; said Joan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear,&rdquo; answered John, &ldquo;few are better
spoken of than they deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do think Denas ought to call on the bride,&rdquo;
said Joan. &ldquo;It would only be friendly, and many
will make a talk about it if she does not go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must find out, first, if the young man be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Denas warmly, &ldquo;I will not find out.
If you cannot trust your little maid, father, then
do not let her go at all. If people could hear you
talk they would say, &lsquo;What a bad girl John Penelles
has! He dare not let her go to see her friend if
there be a young man in the house.&rsquo; &rsquo;Tis a shame,
isn&rsquo;t it, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it be, Denas. Father isn&rsquo;t so cruel
suspicious as that, my dear. Are you, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what could John answer? Though sorely
against his feeling and his judgment, he was induced
to agree that Denas ought perhaps to call once
on the bride. There were so many plausible arguments
in favour of such a visit; there was nothing
but shadowy doubts and fears against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to-morrow, then,&rdquo; said John, a little impatiently;
&ldquo;and let me be done with the fret of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day after-to-morrow, or Wednesday,
father. To-morrow it will be still raining, no
doubt, and I have something to alter in my best
dress. I want to look as fine as I can, father.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Look like yourself and your people, Denas.
That be the best finery. If roses and lilies did grow
on the dusty high-road, they would not be as fitly
pretty as blue-bells and daisies. I do think that,
Denas; and it be the very same with women. Burrell
Court is a matter of two miles beyond St. Penfer;
&rsquo;tis a long walk, my dear, and dress for the walk and
the weather. Do, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the subject was changed, and Denas, having
won her way, was really grateful and disposed to
make the evening happy for all. She recollected
many a little bit of pleasantry; she mimicked Priscilla
to admiration, merrily and without ill-will,
and then she took the story paper and read a thrilling
account of some great shipwrecks and a poem
that seemed to John and Joan&rsquo;s simple minds &ldquo;the
sweetest bit of word music that could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same hour Elizabeth and Roland were
playing an identical r&ocirc;le under different circumstances.
Roland had hoped to slip away to his
room unobserved. He knew Miss Burrell had gone
to a friend&rsquo;s house for a day or two, and he thought
Robert and Elizabeth would be sufficiently occupied
with each other. But some gentlemen were with
Robert on parish business, and Elizabeth was alone
and well inclined to come to an understanding with
her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline had to go without an escort, Roland.
It was too bad,&rdquo; she said reproachfully as she stood
in the open door of a parlour and waited for his approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I am wet through, Elizabeth. I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
change my clothing and come to you. Where is
Robert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the churchwardens. I want to talk to you
seriously. We shall be alone for an hour. Come
as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In five minutes. It will be delightful to have
you all to myself once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back quickly and placed his chair close
to hers, and lifted her face to his face and kissed
her, saying fondly, &ldquo;My dear little sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been, Roland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could have bet on the words &lsquo;Where have
you been?&rsquo; That is always a woman&rsquo;s first question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been with Denas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been at the Black Lion and at Tremaine&rsquo;s.
We will suppose that I wished to see
Denas&ndash;&ndash;is this pouring rain a fit condition? Do
think of something more likely, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say to me plainly: &lsquo;I have not seen Denas.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish me to say the words, consider that
I have done so. Why have you taken a dislike to
Denas? You used to be very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not taken any dislike to the girl. I have
simply passed out of the season of liking her. In
the early spring we find the violet charming, but
when summer comes we forget the violet in the
rose and the lily and the garden full of richer flowers.
The time for Denas has passed&ndash;&ndash;that is all,
Roland. What are you going to do about Caroline?
When will you ask her to marry you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked her twice already; once in Rome,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
when she put me off; and again in London, when
she decidedly refused me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she believed she could trust herself to my
love, because she did not think I would be unkind
to any woman; but she was sure she could not trust
me with her fortune, because I would waste it without
any intention of being wasteful. Caroline wants
a financier, not a lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She talked about the responsibilities of wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could she talk to you in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did&ndash;&ndash;really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Caroline is out of reckoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves, I think she was right,
Elizabeth. I am positive I should spend any sum
of money. What I need is a wife who can make
money week by week, year by year&ndash;&ndash;always something
coming in; like an opera-singer, for instance.
Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you expect me to understand such nonsense?
I asked Robert to-day about poor father&rsquo;s
estate. He thinks there may be four or five hundred
pounds after paying all debts. Of course you will
receive it all. Robert is very kind, but I can see
that he would prefer that you were not always at
the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay he put Caroline up to refuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it. He would consider it a
brotherly duty; and to tell the truth, Roland, I
fear you would give any woman lots of heartache.
I cannot tell what must be done. You have had so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
many good business chances, and yet never made
anything of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Elizabeth. If I take to a business,
it fails. If I dream of some fine prospect, the
dream does not come true. In fact, my dear sister,</p>

also wondered in her heart why everyone else did
not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sweet sister, that wealth is not exactly
the same thing as shining virtue, or else Caroline
would have been generous. I am sure I should be
particularly grateful to any woman who made me
rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why woman, Roland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, because if a man puts any money in my
way he expects me to work for it and with it; to
invest it and double it; to give an account of it; to
sacrifice myself body and soul for it. But a dear
little darling woman would never ask me questions
and never worry me about interest. She would take
love and kisses as full value received&ndash;&ndash;unless she
was a girl like Caroline, an unwomanly, mercenary,
practical, matter-of-money creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not talk in that way of Caroline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am talking of her money, and it is no impeachment
of its value to say that it is mortal like
herself. Still, I am ready to acknowledge</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Roland, I really do not know what you are
fit for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had been born three or four centuries ago I
could have been a knight-errant or a troubadour.
But alas! in these days the knight-errants go to the
Stock Exchange and the troubadours write for the
newspapers. I am not fitted to wrestle with the
wild beasts of the money market; I would rather go
to Spain and be a matador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland, here comes Robert. Do try and talk
like a man of ordinary intelligence. Robert wants
to like you&ndash;&ndash;wants to help you if you will let

<p>&ldquo;Yes, in his way. I want to be helped in my own
way. Good-evening, Robert! I am glad you were
not caught in the rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grave face brightened to the charm of the
young man, and then for an hour Roland delighted
his sister by his sensible consideration, by his patient
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
attention to some uninteresting details, by his prudence
in speaking of the future; so that Robert
said confidentially to his wife that night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland is a delightful young man. There must
be some niche he can fill with honour. I wonder
that Caroline could resist his attentions. Yet she
told me to-day that she had refused him twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Caroline is moved by her intellect, not by her
heart. Also, she is very Vere-de-Vereish, and she
has set her mark for a lord, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can be done for Roland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He talked of going into the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Going into the army means, for
Roland, going into every possible temptation and
expense&ndash;&ndash;that would not do. But he ought to be
away from this little town. He will be making
mischief if he cannot find it ready-made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very uneasy about that girl from the fishing
village, the girl whom I used to have with me
a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas&ndash;&ndash;the girl with the wonderful voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Did you think her voice wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should say haunting voice. She had
certainly some unusual gift. I do not pretend to
be able to define it. But I remember every line
of the first measure I heard her sing. Many a time
since I have thought my soul was singing it for its
own pleasure, without caring whether I liked it or
not; for when mentally reckoning up a transaction
I have heard quite distinctly the rhythmical rolling
cadence, like sea wave, to which the words were
set. I hear it now.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Robert, you are very complimentary
to Denas. I shall be jealous, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not complimentary to Denas at all. I hardly
remember what the girl looked like. And it is not
worth while being jealous of a voice, for I can assure
you, Elizabeth, a haunting song is a most unwelcome
visitor when your brain is full of figures.
And somehow it generally managed to come at a
time when the bank and the street were both in
a tumult with the sound of men&rsquo;s voices, the roll
of wagons, and the tramp of horses&rsquo; feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A song of the sea in the roar of the city! How
strange! I am curious to hear it: I have forgotten
most of the songs Denas sang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The roar of the city appeared to provoke it.
When it was loudest I usually heard most clearly
the sweet thrilling echo, asking</p>

the charmful words, she took a sudden dislike
to Denas. But she said: &ldquo;The song is a lovely
song, and I must send for Denas to sing it again for
us.&rdquo; In her heart she resolved never to send for
Denas; &ldquo;though if she does come&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;and at this

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> rain was over on Wednesday morning, but
the day was gray and chill and the crisping
turf and the hardening road indicated a coming
frost. There was nothing, however, to prevent the
contemplated visit to Burrell Court, and a painful
momentary shadow flitted over John&rsquo;s face when
Denas came to breakfast in her new ruby-coloured
merino dress. She was so pretty, so full of the importance
of her trip, so affectionate, that he could
not say a word to dash her spirits or warn her carelessness,
and yet he had a quick spasm of terror
about the danger she was going so gayly into. Of
what use, alas! are our premonitions if they do not
bring with them the inexorable moral courage necessary
to enforce their warnings?</p>
<p>Denas had been accustomed to go to Elizabeth&rsquo;s
very early in the morning, and it did not come into
her mind to make any change in this respect because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
of Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriage. So after she had
taken her breakfast she put on her hat and ulster
and her warm wool gloves and took the cliff road.
John, with his pipe in his mouth, leaned against the
door lintel and watched her. Joan stood by his
side for a moment, following with her eyes the
graceful figure of her child, but she quickly went
back to her work. John&rsquo;s work was over for the
day; he had come in on the dawn tide with a good
take. So he stood at the door, in spite of the
frosty air, and watched his little maid climb the
hilly road with the elastic step and untiring breath
of happy youth.</p>
<p>It was then only eight o&rsquo;clock. No one at her
home had thought the hour too early. But when
she reached Burrell Court Elizabeth had not come
downstairs and breakfast was not yet served. She
was much annoyed and embarrassed by the attitude
of the servants. She had no visiting-card, and the
footman declined to disturb Mrs. Burrell at her
toilet. &ldquo;Miss could wait,&rdquo; he said with an air of
familiarity which greatly offended Denas. For she
considered herself, as the child of a fisherman owning
his own cottage and boat and lord of all the
leagues of ocean where he chose to cast his nets,
immeasurably the superior of any servant, no matter
how fine his livery might be.</p>
<p>She sat down in the small reception-room into
which she had been shown and waited. She heard
Elizabeth and her husband go through the hall
together, and the pleasant odours of coffee and
broiled meats certified to the serving of breakfast.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
But no one came near her. As the minutes slipped
away her wonder became anger; and she was resolving
to leave the inhospitable house when she
heard Roland&rsquo;s step. He came slowly down the
polished oak stairs, went to the front door, opened
it and looked out into the frosty day; then turning
rapidly in from the cold, he went whistling softly
through the hall to the breakfast-room.</p>
<p>Just as he entered the footman was saying: &ldquo;A
young person, ma&rsquo;am. She had no card, and when
I asked her name she only looked at me, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you put her?&rdquo; asked Elizabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the small reception-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the room warm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very cold, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Robert Burrell looked at his wife
and said: &ldquo;It is perhaps that little friend of yours,
called Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove!&rdquo; ejaculated Roland. &ldquo;I should not wonder.
You know, Elizabeth, she was always an early
visitor. Shall I go and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frederick will go. Frederick, ask the young
person her name.&rdquo; In a few moments Frederick
returned and said, &ldquo;Miss Penelles is the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Robert Burrell and Roland both looked at
Elizabeth. She had a momentary struggle with
herself; she hesitated, her brows made themselves
into a point, her colour heightened, and the dead
silence gave her a most eloquent chance to listen
to her own heart. She rose with leisurely composure
and left the room. Mr. Burrell and Roland
took no notice of the movement. Mr. Burrell had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
his watch in his hand; Roland was directing Frederick
as to the particular piece of fowl he wanted.
Then there was a little laugh and the sound of
voices, and Elizabeth and Denas entered together.
Elizabeth had made Denas remove her hat and
cloak, and the girl was exceedingly pretty. Roland
leaped to his feet and imperatively motioned Frederick
to place a chair beside his own, and Robert
Burrell met her with a frank kindness which was
pleasantly reassuring.</p>
<p>Denas had been feeling wronged and humiliated,
but Elizabeth by a few kind words of apology had
caused a reaction which affected her inexperienced
guest with a kind of mental intoxication. Her
countenance glowed, her eyes sparkled, her hair
appeared to throw off light; her ruby-coloured dress
with its edges of white lace accentuated the marvellous
colouring of her cheeks and lips, the snow-white
of her wide brows and slender throat, and the
intense blue of eyes that had caught the brightest
tone of sea and sky.</p>
<p>She talked well, she was witty without being ill-natured,
and she described all that had happened in
the little town since Elizabeth&rsquo;s wedding-day with
a subdued and charming mimicry that made the
room ring with laughter. Also, she ate her breakfast
with such evident enjoyment that she gave an
appetite to the <a name='TC_3'></a><ins title="Added period">others.</ins> All took an extra cup of
coffee with her, and it seemed only a part of the
general conversation and delightful intercourse.</p>
<p>After breakfast <a name='TC_4'></a><ins title="Was 'Bobert'">Robert</ins> Burrell said he would
delay his visit to London for a train if Denas would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
sing for him once more; and they went together
to the parlour, and Roland fell at once into the rocking
measure of Robert&rsquo;s favourite, and in the middle
of a bar Denas joined her voice to it, and they went
together as the wind goes through the trees or the
song of the water through its limpid flow.</p>
<p>As she finished, Roland looked at her with a certain
intelligence in his eyes, and then struck a few
wild, startling chords. They proved to be the basis
of a sea-chant. Denas heard them with a quick
movement of her head and an involuntary though
slight movement of the hands, as she cried out in a
musical cadence:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Here beginneth the sea,</p>
<p>That ends not until the world ends.</p>
<p>Blow, westerly wind, for me!</p>
<p>When the wind and the tide are friends,</p>
<p>Westerly wind and little white star,</p>
<p>Safe are the fishermen over the bar.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>She would sing no more when the chant was finished.
She had seen a look on Elizabeth&rsquo;s face, not intended
for her to see, which took the music out of her heart.
Yet she had sung enough, for she had never before
sung so well. She was astonished at her own power,
and Robert Burrell thanked her with a sincerity
beyond question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brain will be among figures all the way to
London, Miss Penelles,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I am quite
sure my soul will be wandering on the shingle, and
feeling the blowing winds, and hearing the plash of
the waves, and singing with all its power:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></div>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here beginneth the sea,</p>
<p>That ends not till the world ends.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Then he went away, and Elizabeth took her embroidery
and sat down with Denas. A great gulf
suddenly opened between them. There was no subject
to talk about. Elizabeth had sent Roland
away on the double pretence of wanting him to take
a message to Caroline and of wanting to have
Denas all to herself. And she watched Roland so
cleverly that he had no opportunity to say a word
to Denas; and yet he had, for in bidding her good-bye
he managed, by the quick lift of his brows and
the wide-open look in his eyes, to give her assurance
that he would be at their usual place of meeting.
Elizabeth was a clever woman, but no match
for a man who has love in his heart and his eyes to
speak for him.</p>
<p>So she had Denas all to herself, and then, in spite
of everything she could do, her manner became
indifferent and icy. She asked after John and Joan
and more pointedly after Tris. And Denas thought
there could be no harm in talking of Tris and his
affection for her. She chattered away until she felt
she was not being listened to. Then she tried to
talk of the past; Elizabeth said it was so associated
with poor papa she would rather not talk of
it. It was very painful to her, and she had promised
Mr. Burrell not to indulge in painful thoughts. So
Denas felt that the past was a shut and clasped book
between them for ever.</p>
<p>Nothing remained but to ask Elizabeth about her
wedding-trip. She answered her, but not as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
would have answered an acquaintance of her own
circle. In her heart she felt it to be a presumption
in Denas. Why should this girl question her about
her opinions and doings? Her conscience had continually
to urge her to justice, and she felt the strife
of feeling to be very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Denas had hoped to be shown all the pretty dresses
and cloaks and knick-knacks of fine wearing apparel
that Elizabeth had bought in London, Paris, and
other European capitals. These things had been
much talked of in the town, and it would have been
a little distinction to Denas to have seen and
handled them. Perhaps, also, there had been, in her
deepest consciousness, a hope that Elizabeth had
brought her some special gift&ndash;&ndash;some trinket that
she could be proud of all her life and keep in
memory of their early friendship.</p>
<p>But Elizabeth showed her nothing and gave her
nothing; moreover, when Denas spoke of the beautiful
morning robe she wore, Elizabeth frowned
slightly and answered with an evident disinclination
to discuss the subject, &ldquo;Yes, it is beautiful.&rdquo;
For though Elizabeth did not analyse the feeling,
she was annoyed at even a verbal return to a time
when gowns of every kind had been a consideration
worth while discussing with one whose taste and
skill would help to fashion them. Poverty casts
only shadows on memory, and few people like to
stand voluntarily again in them.</p>
<p>About noon there was a visitor, and Elizabeth
received her in another room. She made an apology
to Denas, but the girl, left to herself, began to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
angry with herself. She could hear Elizabeth and
her caller merrily discussing the affairs of their own
set, and Elizabeth had quite a different voice; it
was sympathetic, ready to break into laughter, full
of confidential tones. Denas remembered this voice
well. She had once been used to hear it and to
blend her own with it. Her heart burned when she
called to mind her old friend&rsquo;s excessive civility;
her hardly concealed weariness; the real coldness
of feeling which no pleasant words could warm.
There was no longer any sympathy between them;
there was not even any interest which could take
the place of sympathy. Elizabeth did not really
care whether Denas was offended or not, but she
had a conscience, and it urged her to be kind and
just. And she did try to obey the order, but when
orders perversely go against inclination they do
not obtain a cheerful service.</p>
<p>Denas felt and thought quickly: &ldquo;I am not
wanted here. I ought to go away, and I will go.&rdquo;
These resolutions were arrived at by apprehension,
not by any definable process of reasoning. She
touched a bell, asked for her hat and cloak, left a
message for Elizabeth, and went away from Burrell
Court at once.</p>
<p>The rapid walk to St. Penfer relieved her feelings.
&ldquo;I have been wounded to-day,&rdquo; she sobbed,
&ldquo;just as really as if Elizabeth had flung a stone at
me or stabbed me with a knife. I am heart-hurt.
I am sorry I went to see her. Why did I go? She
is afraid of Roland! Good! I shall pay her back
through Roland. If she will not be a friend to me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
she may have to call me sister.&rdquo; Then she remembered
what Roland had said about her voice and
her face was illumined by the thought, and she
lifted her head and stepped loftily to it. &ldquo;She may
be proud enough of me yet. I wonder what I have
done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To such futile questions and reflections, she
walked back to St. Penfer. She had not yet found
out that the sum of her offending lay in her ability
to add the four letters which spelled the word fair
to her name. If she had been strikingly ugly and
dull, instead of strikingly pretty and bright, Elizabeth
would have found it easier to be kind and generous
to her.</p>
<p>Denas went to Priscilla Mohun&rsquo;s. Reticence is
a cultivated quality, and Denas had none of it; so
she told the whole story of her ill-treatment to
Priscilla and found her full of sympathy. Priscilla
had her own little slights to relate, and if all was
true she told Denas, then Elizabeth had managed
in a week&rsquo;s time to offend many of her old acquaintances
irreconcilably.</p>
<p>Denas remained with Priscilla until three o&rsquo;clock;
then she walked down the cliff to the little glade
where she hoped to find Roland. He was not there.
She calculated the distance he had to ride, she
made allowance for his taking lunch with Caroline
Burrell, and she concluded that he ought to have
been at the trysting-place before she was. She
waited until four o&rsquo;clock, growing more angry every
moment, then she hastened away. &ldquo;I am right
served,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I will let Roland Tresham
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
and Elizabeth Burrell alone for the future.&rdquo; The
tide of anger rose swiftly in her heart, and she
stepped homeward to its flow.</p>
<p>She had gone but a little way when she heard
Roland calling her. She would not answer him.
She heard his rapid footsteps behind, but she would
not turn her head. When he reached her he was
already vexed at her perverse mood. &ldquo;I could not
get here sooner, Denas,&rdquo; he said crossly. &ldquo;Do be
reasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not have come at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas, stop: Listen to me. If you walk so
quickly we shall be seen from the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish father to see us. I will call him to come
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas, what have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! You are a part of the whole. Your sister
has taught me to-day the difference between us. I
am glad there is a difference&ndash;&ndash;I intend to forget you
both from this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you punish me because Elizabeth was
unkind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day you also will change just as she has
done. I will not wait for that day. No, indeed!
To be sure, I shall suffer. Father, mother, everybody
suffers in one way or another. I can bear as
much as others can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an absurd little thing. Come, darling!
Come back with me! I want to tell you a very particular
secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you can pet, or coax, or tell me
tales like a cross child? I am a woman, and I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
been hurt in every place a woman can be hurt by
your sister. I will not go back with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Denas. You will repent this temper,
I can tell you, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shall not repent it. I will go to my father
and mother. I will tell them how bad I have been
and ask them to forgive me. I shall never repent
that, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew her arm from his clasp and, without
lifting her eyes to him, went forward with a swift,
purposeful step. He watched her a few moments,
and then with a dark countenance turned homeward.
&ldquo;This is Elizabeth&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Elizabeth
is too, too detestably respectable for anything.
I saw and felt her sugared patronage of Denas
through all her soft phrases; she treats me in the
same way sometimes. When women get a husband
they are conceited enough, but when they get a
husband and money also they are&ndash;&ndash;the devil only
knows what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered Elizabeth&rsquo;s presence very sulkily.
Robert was in London and there was no reason
why he should keep his temper in the background.
&ldquo;There is Caroline&rsquo;s answer,&rdquo; he said, throwing a
letter on the table, &ldquo;and I do wish, Elizabeth, you
would send me pleasanter errands in the future.
Caroline kept me waiting until she returned from a
lunch at Colonel Prynne&rsquo;s. And then she hurried me
away because there was to be a grand dinner-party
at the Pullens&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Pullens&rsquo;? It is very strange Robert and
I were not invited.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say very strange indeed, seeing that
Caroline is their guest. But Lord and Lady Avonmere
were to be present, and of course they did
not want any of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any of us? Pray, why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s bankruptcy is not forgotten. We were
nobodies until you married Robert Burrell, and
even Robert&rsquo;s money is all trade money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are purposely trying to say disagreeable
things, Roland. What fresh snub has Caroline been
giving you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snubs are common to all. Big people are
snubbed by lesser people, and these by still smaller
ones, and so <i>ad infinitum</i>. You are a bit bigger than
Denas, so you snub her, and Denas, of course, passes
on the snub. Why should she not? Where is
Denas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone home, and I do hope she will never
come here again. She behaved very impertinently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will not believe. Put the shoe on your
own foot, Elizabeth. You were rude before I left,
and I dare swear you were rude, ruder, rudest after
you were alone with the girl. For pure spite and
ill-nature, a newly married woman beats the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking to, Roland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To you. I have to talk plainly to you occasionally&ndash;&ndash;birds
in their little nests agree, but brothers
and sisters do not; in fact, they cannot. For instance,
I should be a brute if I agreed with you
about Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say that Denas behaved very rudely. She
went away without my knowledge and without bidding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
me good-bye. I shall decline to have any
more to do with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt she has already declined you
in every possible form. As far as I can judge, she
is a spirited little creature. But gracious! how
she did sing this morning! I&rsquo;ll bet you fifty pounds
if Robert Burrell had heard her sing a year ago
you would not have been mistress of Burrell Court
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either you or I must leave the room, Roland.
I will not listen any longer to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit still. I am very glad to go. I shall take a
room at the Black Lion to-morrow. The atmosphere
of the Court is so exquisitely rarefied and
refined that I am choking in it. I only hope you
may not smother Robert in it. Good-night! I
notice Robert goes to London pretty often lately.
Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he closed the door sharply and went smiling
to his room. &ldquo;I think I have made madame quite
as uncomfortable as she has made me,&rdquo; he muttered,
&ldquo;and I will go to the Black Lion to-morrow. From
there I can reach Denas without being watched at
both ends. John Penelles to the right and Elizabeth
Burrell to the left of me are too much and too
many. For Denas I must see. I must see her if I
have to dress myself in blue flannels and oil-skins
to manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Elizabeth ate her breakfast alone.
She had determined to have a good quarrel with
Roland, and make him ashamed of his speech and
behaviour on the previous evening. But before she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
rose Roland had gone to the Black Lion, and moreover
he had left orders for his packed traps and
trunks to be sent after him. He had a distinct object
in this move. At the Court he was constantly
under surveillance, and he was also very much at
Elizabeth&rsquo;s commands. He had little time to give
to the pursuit of Denas, and that little at hours
unsuitable for the purpose. But at the Black Lion
his time was all his own. He could breakfast and
dine at whatever hour suited his occupation; he
could watch the movements of Denas without being
constantly suspected and brought to book.</p>
<p>Her temper the previous evening, while it seriously
annoyed, did not dishearten him. He really liked
her better for its display. He never supposed that
it would last. He expected her to make a visit to
St. Penfer the next day; she would hope that he
would be on the watch for her; she would be sure
of it.</p>
<p>But Denas did not visit St. Penfer that week, and
Roland grew desperate. On Saturday night he went
down the cliff after dark and hung around John&rsquo;s
cottage, hoping that for some reason or other
Denas would come to the door. He had a note in
his hand ready to put into her hand if she did so.
He could see her plainly, for the only screen to the
windows was some flowering plants inside and a
wooden shutter on the outside, never closed but in
extreme bad weather. Joan was making the evening
meal, John sat upon the hearth, and Denas, with her
knitting in her hands, was by his side. Once or twice
he saw her rise and help her mother with some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
homely duty, and finally she laid down her work,
and, kneeling on the rug at her father&rsquo;s feet, she
began to toast the bread for their tea. Her unstudied
grace, the charm of her beauty and kindness, the
very simplicity of her dress, fascinated him afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the costume&ndash;&ndash;the very costume&ndash;&ndash;she
ought to sing in,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;With some fishing
nets at her feet and the mesh in her hands, how
that dark petticoat and that little scarlet josey would
tell; the scarlet josey cut away just so at the neck.
What a ravishing throat she has! How white and
round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point in his reverie he heard footsteps,
and he walked leisurely aside. His big ulster in
the darkness was a sufficient disguise; he had no
fear of being known by any passer-by. But these
footsteps stopped at John&rsquo;s door and then went
inside the cottage. That circumstance roused in
Roland&rsquo;s heart a tremor he had never known before.
He cautiously returned to his point of observation.
The visitor was a young and handsome fisherman.
It was Tris Penrose. Roland saw with envy his
welcome and his familiarity. He saw that Joan had
placed for him a chair on the hearth opposite John;
Denas, therefore, was at his feet also. Tris could
feed his eyes upon her near loveliness. He could
speak to her. He did speak to her, and Denas
looked up with a smile to answer him. When the
toast was made Tris helped Denas to her feet; he
put her chair to the table, he put his own beside it.
He waited upon her with such delight and tender
admiration that Roland was made furiously angry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
and miserable by his rival&rsquo;s happiness. The poor
ape jealousy began meddling in all his better
feelings.</p>
<p>He hung around the cottage until he was freezing
with cold and burning with rage. &ldquo;And this is
Elizabeth&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; he kept muttering as he
climbed the cliff to the upper town. He could not
sleep all night. He thought of everything that
could add to his despairing uncertainty. The next
day was the Sabbath. Denas would go to chapel
with her father and mother. Tris would be sure to
meet her there, to return home with her, to sit again
at her side on that bright, homelike hearthstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I were a fisher,&rdquo; he cried passionately.
&ldquo;They know what it is to live, for their boats
make their cottages like heaven.&rdquo; He could not
deny to himself that Tris was a very handsome fellow
and that Denas smiled pleasantly at him.
&ldquo;But she never smiled once as she smiles at me.
He never once drew her soul into her face, as I can
draw it. She does not love him as she loves me.&rdquo;
With such assertions he consoled his heart, the while
he was trying to form some plan which would give
him an opportunity to get Denas once more under
his influence.</p>
<p>On Monday morning he went to see Priscilla
Mohun. He had a long conversation with the dressmaker,
and that afternoon Priscilla walked down to
John&rsquo;s cottage and made a proposal to Denas. It
was so blunt and business-like, so tight in regard to
money matters, that John and Joan, and Denas also,
were completely deceived. She said she had heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
that Denas and Tris Penrose were to be married,
and she thought Denas might like to make some
steady money to help the furnishing. She would
give her two shillings a day and her board and
lodging. Also, she could have Saturday and Sunday
at her home if she wished.</p>
<p>Denas, who was fretted by the monotony of home
duties really too few to employ both her mother and
herself, was glad of the offer. John, who had a
little vein of parsimony in his fine nature, thought
of the ten shillings a week and of how soon it
would grow to be ten pounds. Joan remembered
how much there was to see and hear at Miss Priscilla&rsquo;s,
and Denas was so dull at home! Why should
she not have a good change when it was well paid
for? And then she remembered the happy week-ends
there would be, with so much to tell and to
talk over.</p>
<p>She asked Priscilla to stay and have a cup of tea
with them, and so settle the subject. And the
result was that Denas went back to St. Penfer with
Priscilla and began her duties on the next day.
That evening she had a letter from Roland. It was
a letter well adapted to touch her heart. Roland
was really miserable, and he knew well how to cry
out for comfort. He told her he had left his sister&rsquo;s
home because Elizabeth had insulted her there.
He led her to believe that Elizabeth was in great
distress at his anger, but that nothing she could say
or do would make him forgive her until Denas herself
was satisfied.</p>
<p>And Denas was glad that Elizabeth should suffer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
She hoped Roland would make her suffer a great
deal. For Denas had not yet reached that divine
condition in which it is possible to love one&rsquo;s
enemies. She was happy to think that Roland was
at the Black Lion with all his possessions; for she
knew how the gossip on this occurrence would annoy
all the proprieties in Mrs. Burrell&rsquo;s social code.</p>
<p>Her anger served Roland&rsquo;s purpose quite as much
as her love. After the third letter she wrote a reply.
Then she agreed to meet him; then she was quite
under his influence again, much more so, indeed,
than she had ever been before. In a week or two
he got into the habit of dropping into Priscilla&rsquo;s
shop for a pair of gloves, for writing paper, for the
<i>Daily News</i>, for a bottle of cologne&ndash;&ndash;in short, there
were plenty of occasions for a visit, and he took
them. And as Priscilla&rsquo;s was near the Black Lion
and the only news depot in town, and as other gentlemen
went frequently there also for the supply of
their small wants, no one was surprised at Roland&rsquo;s
purchases. His intercourse with Priscilla was obviously
of the most formal character; she treated
him with the same short courtesy she gave to all and
sundry, and Denas was so rarely seen behind the
counter that she was not in any way associated with
the customers. This indeed had been the stipulation
on which John had specially insisted.</p>
<p>One morning Roland came hurriedly into the
shop. &ldquo;My sister is coming here, I am sure, Miss
Mohun,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell Denas, if you please, she
said she wished to meet her again. Tell her I will
remain here and stand by her.&rdquo; There was no time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
to deliberate, and Denas, acting upon the feeling of
the moment, came quickly to Roland, and was talking
to him when Mrs. Burrell entered. They remained
in conversation a moment or two, as if loth
to part; then Denas advanced to the customer with
an air of courtesy, but also of perfect ignorance as
to her personality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Denas?&rdquo; said the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to see Miss Priscilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas touched a bell and returned to Roland,
who had appeared to be unconscious of his sister&rsquo;s
presence. Elizabeth glanced at her brother; then,
without waiting for Priscilla, left the shop. The
lovely face of Denas was like a flame. &ldquo;Thank
you, Roland!&rdquo; she said with effusion. &ldquo;You have
paid my account in full for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, darling, let me come here to-night and
say something very important to us both. Priscilla
will give me house-room for an hour, I know she
will. Here she comes. Let me ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla affected reluctance, but really she was
prepared for the request. She had expected it before
and had been uneasy at its delay. She was
beginning to fear Roland&rsquo;s visits might be noticed,
might be talked about, might injure her custom. It
pleased her much to anticipate an end to a risky
situation. She managed, without urging Denas, to
make the girl feel that her relations with Roland
ought either to be better understood or else entirely
broken off.</p>
<p>So Roland went back to his inn with a promise
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
that made him light-hearted. &ldquo;Elizabeth has done
me one good turn,&rdquo; he soliloquized. &ldquo;Now let me
see. I will consider my plea and get all in order.
First, I must persuade Denas to go to London.
Second, the question is, marriage or no marriage?
Third, her voice and its cultivation. Fourth, the
hundred pounds in St. Merryn&rsquo;s Bank. Fifth, everything
as soon as can be&ndash;&ndash;to-morrow night if possible.
Sixth, my own money from Tremaine. I should
have about four hundred pounds. Heigho! I wish
it was eight o&rsquo;clock. And what an old cat Priscilla
is! I do not think I shall give her the fifty pounds
I promised her. She does not deserve it&ndash;&ndash;and she
never durst ask me for it.&rdquo;</p>

Roland expected all his own world to turn to
his love. The self-denying, forbearing, loyal affection
Elizabeth had shown him all her life was now
of no value, since she did not sympathize with his
love for Denas. John and Joan Penelles were the
objects of his dislike and scorn because they could
not see their daughter&rsquo;s future as he saw it. He
thought it only right that Priscilla Mohun should
risk her business and her reputation for the furtherance
of his romantic love affair. He had easily
persuaded himself that it was utterly contemptible
in her to expect any financial reward for a service
of love.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></div>
<p>Denas had more force of character. She was
offended at Elizabeth because Elizabeth had
wounded her self-respect and put her into a most
humiliating position. She was too truthful not to
admit that Elizabeth had from the first hour of their
acquaintance openly opposed anything like love-making
between Roland and herself. She understood
and acknowledged the rights of her parents.
In trampling on them she knew that she was sinning
with her eyes open. And if Roland spent the
day in arranging his plans for the future, she spent
it in facing squarely the thing she had determined
to do.</p>
<p>For she was aware that Roland was coming that
night to urge her to go to London and become a
public singer. She did not know how much money
would be required, but she knew that whatever the
sum was it must come from Roland. Then, of
course, she must marry Roland at once. Under no
other relationship could she take money from him.
Yet on carefully questioning her memory she was
sure that the subject of marriage had been avoided,
or, at any rate, not spoken of in any discussion of
her future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, with a swift motion of determination,
&ldquo;that is the first subject, and the one on
which all others depend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock Roland was with her. He came
with his most irresistible manner, came prepared to
carry his own desires in an enthusiasm of that supreme
selfishness which he chose to designate as
&ldquo;love for Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You have only to learn how to manage that
wonderful voice of yours, Denas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and a
steady flow of money will be the result. You must
have read of the enormous sums singers receive, but
we will be modest at first and suppose you only make
a few hundreds a year. In the long run that will
be nothing; and you will be a very rich woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have often said such things to me, Roland.
But perhaps you do not judge me severely enough.
I must see a great teacher, and he will tell me the
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. And you must have lessons also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for these things there must be money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I have upward of five hundred
pounds and you have one hundred at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing, Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The money you told me of in St. Merryn&rsquo;s
Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot touch that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I will not. Father has been saving it
ever since I was born. If he is sick it is all he
has to live upon. It is bad enough to desert my
parents; I will not rob them also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not look at things in such extreme
ways. You are going to spend money in order to
make a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not spend father&rsquo;s money&ndash;&ndash;the fortune
may never come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there is my money. You are welcome to
every penny of it. All I have is yours. I only
live for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;To say such things, Roland, is the way to marry
me&ndash;&ndash;if you mean to marry me&ndash;&ndash;is it not? Among
the fishermen it is so, only they would say first of
all, &lsquo;I do wish to be your husband.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a fisherman, Denas. And it would really
be very dishonourable to bind your fortune irrevocably
to mine. In a couple of years you would be apt
to say: &lsquo;Roland played me a mean trick, for he
made me his wife only that he might have all the
money I earn.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you see what a dreadful position
I should be in? I should be ashamed to
show my face. Really, dearest, I must look after
my honour. My money&ndash;&ndash;that is nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland, if honour and money cannot go together,
there is something wrong. If I went to
London alone and you were also in London and
paying for my lessons, do you know what everyone
would say in St. Penfer? Do you know what they
would call me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why need you care for a lot of old gossips&ndash;&ndash;you,
with such a grand future before you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do care. I care for myself. I care a thousand
times more for father and mother. A word
against my good name would kill them. They
would never hold up their heads any more. And
then, however bad a name the public gave me, I
should give myself a worse one; I should indeed!
Night and day my soul would never cease saying
to me: &lsquo;Denas Penelles, you are a murderess!
Hanging is too little for you. Get out of this life
and go to your own place&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;and you know where
that would be.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You silly, bigoted little Methodist! People do
not die of grief in these days, they have too much
to do. You would soon be able to send them a
great deal of money, and that would put all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For shame, Roland! Little you know of St.
Penfer fishermen, nothing at all you know of John
and Joan Penelles, if you think a city full of gold
would atone to them for my dishonour. What is
the use of going around about our words when there
are straight ones enough to say? I will go to London
as your wife, or I will not go at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a momentary expression on Roland&rsquo;s
face which might have terrified Denas if she had
seen it, but her gaze was far outward; she was
looking down on the waves and the boats of St.
Penfer and on one little cottage on its shingle.
And Roland&rsquo;s hasty glance into her resolute face
convinced him that all parleying was useless. He
was angry and could not quite control himself.
His voice showed decided pique as he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Denas. Take care of your own honour,
by all means; mine is of no value, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think marrying me makes it of no value,
take care of your own honour, Roland. I will not
be your wife; no, indeed. And as for London, I
will not go near it. And as for my voice, it may
be worth money, but it is not worth my honour, and
my good name, and my father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s life.
Why should I sing for strangers? I will sing for
my father and the fishers on the sea; and I will
sing in the chapel&ndash;&ndash;and there is an end of the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></div>
<p>She rose with such an air of decision and wounded
feeling that Roland involuntarily thought of her
attitude when Elizabeth offended her. From the
position taken at that hour she had never wavered;
she was still as angry at Mrs. Burrell as she had
been when she left the Court in the first outburst of
her indignation. And she was so handsome in her
affected indifference and her real indignation that
Roland was ready to sacrifice everything rather than
lose her. He let all other considerations slip away
from him; he vowed that his chief longing, his
most passionate desire, was to marry her&ndash;&ndash;to make
her his and his only; and that nothing but a chivalric
sense of the wrong he might be doing her
future had made him hesitate. And then he eloquently
praised himself for such a nicety of honour,
and tried to make her understand how really noble
he had been in his self-denial, and how hard it was
for him to be accused of the very thing he was trying
to avoid. And he looked so injured, with his
beautiful eyes full of tears, that Denas was privately
ashamed of herself, and fearful that she had in defence
of her modesty gone beyond proper boundaries.</p>
<p>Then the subject of their marriage was frankly
discussed. Roland was now honest and earnest
enough, and yet Denas felt that the charm of the
great question and answer had been lost in considering
it. Spontaneity&ndash;&ndash;that subtle element of all that
is lovely and enchanting&ndash;&ndash;had flown away at the
first suspicion of constraint. Some sweet illusion
that had always hung like a halo over this grand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
decision evaded her consciousness; the glorious
ideal had become a reality and lost all its enchantments
in the change.</p>
<p>After a long discussion, it was finally arranged
that Roland should meet Denas at a small way-station
about four miles distant on the following
Monday evening. From there they could take a
train to Plymouth, and at Plymouth there was a
Wesleyan minister whom Denas had seen and who
she felt sure would marry them. From Plymouth
to Exeter, Salisbury, and London was a straight
road, and yet one which had many asides and not
too easy to follow; though as to any fear of interruptions,
they were hardly worth considering.
Denas would leave her home as usual on Monday
morning, and her parents would have no expectation
of seeing her until the following Friday night.
By that time she would be settled in London&ndash;&ndash;she
would have been Roland&rsquo;s wife for nearly four days.</p>
<p>These arrangements were made on Friday night,
and on the following morning Denas went home
very early. As she took the cliff-road she felt that
the spirit of change had entered into her heart and
her imagination. The familiar path had become
monotonously dreary; she had a kind of pity for the
people who had not her hope of a speedy escape
from it. The desolate winter beach, the lonely
boats, the closed cottages&ndash;&ndash;how inexorably common
they looked! She felt that there must be something
in the world better for her than such mean
poverty. Roland&rsquo;s words had indeed induced this
utter weariness and contempt for the conditions of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
her life, but the conditions themselves were thus
made to give the most eloquent sanction to his advice
and entreaties.</p>
<p>And when a girl has set her face toward a
wrong road, nothing is sadder in life than the general
certainty there is that every small event will
urge her forward on it. Usually the home-coming
of Denas was watched for and seen afar off, and
some special dainty was simmering on the hob for
her refreshment. There was all the pleasant flurry
that belongs to love&rsquo;s warm welcome. But she had
delayed her return in order to spend the evening
with Roland, and the environments of the morning
had not the same air of easy happiness that attaches
itself to the evening hours.</p>
<p>Joan was elbow-deep in her week&rsquo;s cleaning and
baking. John had the uncomfortable feeling of a
man who knows himself in the way. He had only
loitered around in order to see Denas and be sure
that all was well with his girl. Then he was a
trifle disappointed that she had not brought him
his weekly paper. He went silently off to the boats,
and Denas was annoyed and reproved by his patient
look of disappointment. Women who are cleaning
and baking are often, what is called by people less
troublesomely employed, cross. Denas was sure
her mother was cross and a little unreasonable.
She had not time to listen to the village gossip;
&ldquo;it would keep till evening,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Then she bid Denas hurry up and get her father&rsquo;s
heavy guernsey mended and his bottle of water
filled, ready for the boat. &ldquo;They be going out on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
the noon ebb,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and back with the midnight
tide, and so take thought for the Sabbath; for
your father, he do have to preach over to Pendree
to-morrow, and the sermon more on his mind than
the fishing&ndash;&ndash;God help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will father expect me to walk with him to
Pendree to-morrow, mother? It is too far; I cannot
walk so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he expect you? Not as I know by, Denas&ndash;&ndash;if
you don&rsquo;t want to go. There be girls as would
busy all to do so. But there! it is easy seen you
are neither fatherish or motherish these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish father was rich enough to stay at home
and never go to sea again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be a bit of nonsense! Your father has had
a taking to the sea all his life; and he never could
abide to be boxed up on land. Aw, my dear, John
Penelles is a busker of a fisherman! The storm
never yet did blow that down-daunted him! Tris
says it is a great thing to see your father stand smiling
by the wheel when the lightning be flying all
across the elements and the big waves be threatening
moment by moment to make a mouthful of the boat.
That be the Penelles&rsquo; way, my dear; they come from
a good old <i>haveage</i>;<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> but there, then, it be whist poor
speed we make when our tongues tire our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis like a storm as it can be, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, a young girl should say brave words
or no words at all. &rsquo;Tis not your work to forespeak
bad weather, and I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t do it, Denas;
I do for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></div>
<p>In an hour John came back and had a mouthful of
meat and bread, but he was hurried and anxious,
and said he had not come yet to his meat-list and
would be off about his business. Then Joan asked
him concerning the weather, and he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gulls do fly high, and that do mean a
breeze; but there be no danger until they fly inland.
The boats will be back before midnight, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the wind do let them, John. Denas says it
be on its contrary old ways again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My old dear, we be safest when the storm-winds
blow; for then God do be keeping the lookout for
us. Joan, my wife, &rsquo;tis not your business to be
looking after the wind, nor mine either; for just
as long as John Penelles trusts his boat to the Great
Pilot, it is sure and certain to come into harbour
right side up. Now, my dear, give me a big jug of
milk, with a little boiling water in it to take off
the edge of the cold, and then I&rsquo;ll away for the gray
fish&ndash;&ndash;if so be God fills the net on either side the
boat for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark, father! The wind has turned to a north-easter&ndash;&ndash;a
bad wind on this coast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not it, Denas. What was it you read me in
that story paper? Some verses by a great and good
man who have been in a stiff north-easter, or else
he never could have got the true grip of it:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Welcome, wild north-easter!</p>
<p>Come, and strong within us</p>
<p>Stir the seaman&rsquo;s blood,</p>
<p>Bracing brain and sinew;</p>
<p>Come, thou wind of God!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is not right, and that is not the whole of
it, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, &rsquo;tis enough, my dear; all that the soul
wants, the memory can hold to&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;tis enough.
Good-bye, and God&rsquo;s keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drank his warm milk, buttoned close his pilot
coat, and went off toward the boats. Denas had
no fear for him, but Joan had not learned trust from
her husband&rsquo;s trust; the iron ring of the wind, the
black sea, the wild sky with its tattered remnants of
clouds, made her full of apprehension. She hurried
her work and was silent over it; while Denas sat
in the little window sewing, and occasionally letting
her eyes wander outward over the lonely beach and
the homely &ldquo;cob&rdquo; cottages of the fishers.</p>
<p>It was a solitary, lonesome, dreary-looking spot
on that bleak winter day; and life inside those
tiny houses was restricted and full of limitations.
Denas thought of them all, but she weighed and
measured the life without taking into account the
love that sat on each hearthstone&ndash;&ndash;the love that
turned the simple houses into homes and the plain,
hard-working men into husbands and sons and
brothers and lovers and saw that they were good
men and brave heroes in spite of their poverty.
Love would have altered her estimate, but she did
not ask love to count with her. She only thought:
&ldquo;If I did not know of a better life, of a life full
of pleasure and change, I might go and live with
Tris and dree my days out with him; but I am now
too wise to be so easily satisfied. I want a house
finer than Elizabeth&rsquo;s; I want grand dresses, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
plenty of servants, and a carriage; and Roland says
all these things are in my voice. Besides, I am far
too pretty to be a fisherman&rsquo;s wife and mend guernseys,
and make nets, and bake fish-pies every day in
the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far too pretty! After all, this was the deepest
thought in her foolish heart. At first, Roland&rsquo;s
pictures of her in picturesque costume, singing to
enthusiastic crowds, had rather terrified her; but she
had let the idea enter her mind, it had become
familiar, then alluring, and finally a delightful
dream. She occupied many hours in devising costumes,
in imagining herself in their colours and
forms, and in considering how the homage she would
receive would be most nobly borne as it affected
Roland. Of course she would throw all at his feet&ndash;&ndash;all
the admiration, all the love, all the gold that
came to her.</p>
<p>She looked at the grave-faced, preoccupied mother
and wished she could talk with her about her
hopes. Roland had expressed himself as greatly
hurt by this inability. &ldquo;Most mothers, Denas,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;would be only too happy to anticipate
such a prospect for their daughter, and you ought to
have had a mother&rsquo;s sympathy and help at this
great epoch of your life. Poor girl! it is too bad
that you are obliged to bear the whole weight of
such a movement yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Denas looked at her mother, and felt aggrieved
by the strict creed which ruled her life.
Methodists were so very narrow. She remembered
her father&rsquo;s anger at a mere proposal of Miss Tresham
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
to take Denas to a theatre with her. She knew
that he believed a theatre to be the open door to
hell; and that the mere idea of men and women,
either with souls saved or souls to be saved, dancing,
filled him with shame and anger. Yet she
was going to sing in a theatre if possible; and Roland
had said a great deal about the fisher dances
of various countries and how effective they would
be with the songs.</p>
<p>At first she had refused to tolerate the idea; she
could not imagine herself dancing to amuse a
crowd of strangers&ndash;&ndash;dancing for money. She thought
of Herodias dancing the Baptist&rsquo;s head off, and she
said solemnly to Roland, and with the utmost sincerity,
that she dared not dance. It was the broad
road to perdition. Roland had not cared to argue
with such a prejudice. He knew well that the
dancing would follow the public singing, as naturally
as the singing followed the professional orchestra.
But he said then, as he said frequently afterward:
&ldquo;It is such a pity, Denas, you have not a mother
you can advise with and who could help and encourage
you. It just locks a girl up in a box to be
born a Methodist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This attitude of Roland&rsquo;s was a very cruel one.
It taught Denas to feel that her secrecy was not her
fault. She continually told herself that she would
have been glad to talk over her future plans with
her parents if they would only have listened to her;
that it was not her fault if they were unreasonable
and bigoted&ndash;&ndash;not her fault if her mind had grown
beyond her surroundings; that her father and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
mother ought to consider that her education and
her companionship with Elizabeth Tresham had led
naturally to the craving for a wider life; and that if
they give the first they ought in common justice to
be ready to consider the consequences with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will not,&rdquo; she thought angrily. &ldquo;They
want me to settle down and be content with Tris
Penrose. I dare not tell them that Roland loves
me. Roland dare not tell them either. I cannot
say a word to them about my voice and the money
it may make. Roland says any reasonable father
and mother would be quite excited at the prospect
and glad to go to London with me. But will my
father and mother do so? Oh, no! In order to do
myself justice I am obliged to run away. It is too
bad! Any sensible person would feel sorry for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With such specious reasoning she satisfied her
conscience, and the afternoon wore away in gathering
gloom and fierce scuds of rain. It was nearly
dark at four o&rsquo;clock, and she rose and brought a
small round table to the hearth and began to put
on it the tea-cups and the bread and butter. As
she did so Joan entered the room. Her arms were
full of clean clothing, but glancing at the table she
threw them above her head, and regardless of the
scattered garments cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas! Look to the loaf! Some poor ship be
in distress! Pray God it be not your father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Denas with trembling hands lifted the loaf,
which she had inadvertently laid down wrong side
upward, and placed it, with a &ldquo;God save the ship
and all in her,&rdquo; in the proper position. But Joan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
was thoroughly unnerved by the ominous incident,
and she sat down with her apron over her head,
rocking herself slowly to her inaudible prayer; while
Denas, with a resentful feeling she did not try to
understand, gathered up the pieces of linen and
flannel her mother had apparently forgotten.</p>
<p>Into this scene stepped a young man in the Burrell
Court livery. He gave Denas a letter, but refused
the offer of a cup of tea, because &ldquo;the storm
was hurrying landward, and he would be busy all
to catch the cliff-top before it caught him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan took no notice of the interruption, and
Denas felt her trouble over such a slight affair as
a turned loaf to be almost a personal offence. In a
short time she said: &ldquo;Mother, your tea is waiting;
and I have a letter from Mrs. Burrell, if you care
anything about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my girl, I care little for Mrs. Burrell&rsquo;s letters
to-night. She be well and happy, no doubt;
and my old dear is in the wind&rsquo;s teeth and pulling
hard against a frosty death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father knows the sky and the sea, and I think
it is cruel hard of him to take such risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where will the fishers be who do take no
risks? Fish be plenty just before a storm, and the
London market-boat waiting for the take; and why
wouldn&rsquo;t the men do their duty, danger or no danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather die than be a fisher&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my girl, the heart for one isn&rsquo;t in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw you so nervous before, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nervous! Nervous! No, my dear, it be downright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
fear. I never knew what fear was before.
I&rsquo;ve gone down-daunted&ndash;&ndash;that be the trouble, Denas.
I&rsquo;ve had such dreams lately&ndash;&ndash;such creepy-like,
ghastly old dreams of wandering in wayless ways
covered with water; of seeing the hearth-place full
of cold ashes and the lights put out; and of carrying
the &lsquo;Grief Child&rsquo; in my breast, a puny, wailing
bit of a baby that I could not be rid of, nor yet
get away from&ndash;&ndash;sights and sounds after me night
and day that do give me a turn to think of; and
what they do mean I haven&rsquo;t mind-light for to see.
God help us! But I do fear they be signs of trouble.
And who goes into the way of trouble but your
father? May God save him from it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trouble is no new thing, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be the truth. Trouble be old as the floods
of Dava.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it does seem to me religious people, who
are always talking about trusting God, are a poor,
unhappy kind. If you do believe, mother, that
God is the good Father you say He is&ndash;&ndash;if you do
think He has led millions to His own heavenly
city&ndash;&ndash;I wonder at you always fearing that He is
going to forget you and let you lose your way and
get into all kinds of danger and sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, then! You be right for once, my dear.
Your father, he do serve the Lord with gladness,
but a wife&rsquo;s heart is nothing but a nest of fear.
And it be true that I do not think so much of serving
the Lord as of having the Lord serve me; and
when it is me and always me, and your heart be
top-full of your dismal old self, how can you serve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
God with gladness? You be right to give me a set-down,
Denas. Come, now, what is Mrs. Burrell&rsquo;s
letter about? I be pleased and ready to hear it
now, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what she says, mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Denas</span>:&ndash;&ndash;I am troubled about Roland and
you. I want very much to talk things over with
you. If I offended you when you were at the Court,
I am very sorry for it. Come and spend a day next
week with me. I will send the carriage to Miss
Mohun&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class='closing'><span class="sig1">&ldquo;&lsquo;Your friend,<br /></span>
<span class="sig2 smcap">&ldquo;&lsquo;Elizabeth Burrell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Why is she troubled about you and that young
man? Is he not in London now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is here, and there, and everywhere. Would
you go to the Court again, mother? I told you how
Elizabeth behaved to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then she had the bride-fever, my dear.
She will be come to her senses by this time. Yes,
yes, if you aren&rsquo;t very sure how to act, take the
kind way rather than the ill way; you will be
mostly right, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Denas had no idea of taking either way,
but the invitation furnished her with a reason for
wearing her best dress on Monday; and she had
been much exercised to find out a cause for this
unusual finery. She felt quite excited over this fortunate
incident, and she could not avoid a smile
when she reflected that Elizabeth had so opportunely
furnished her with the very thing she wanted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>Then for an hour or two Joan quite controlled
herself. She asked after the news of the upper
town, and listened with interest to her daughter&rsquo;s
description of the dresses she was helping to fashion.
From this topic they glided naturally to
Christmas and its coming festivities, and Joan
talked a good deal of the new silver watch they
had decided to give John as a Christmas gift, and
so for some time she was as full of plans and happy
hopes as a little child could be.</p>
<p>She did not notice that after a while Denas grew
weary and constrained, that speech seemed a trouble
to her, that she lost herself frequently in reverie,
and was as nearly nervous as she had accused her
mother of being. But the conversation finally
flagged so much that Joan began to worry about
the weather once more. The wind was now frightful,
the icy rain rattled against the windows, and at
the open door Joan could hear billow on billow,
crash on crash, shrieking blast on shrieking blast.
She was unable to preserve her cheerfulness. Like
all strong hearts in anxiety, she became silent. The
platitudes of Denas, dropped without interest, annoyed
her; she only moved her head in reply.</p>
<p>Midnight came, and no boats. There was a
pitifully frequent opening of cottage doors, and the
sudden flashes of fire and candle light that followed
revealed always some white, fearful face thrust out
into the black night, in the hope of hearing the
shouts of the home-coming men. Joan could not
keep away from the door; and the yawning of
Denas, her shifting movements, her uncontrolled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
sleepiness, irritated Joan. In great anxiety, companionship
not perfectly sympathetic is irritating;
mere mortals quiver under its infliction. For Denas
could not perceive any special reason for unusual
fear; she longed to go to bed and sleep, as she had
done many a time before under the same circumstances.
She laid the Bible on the table before
Joan and said: &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you read a psalm and lie
down a bit, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Read for yourself, and to bed then if you
want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas opened the book. Her father&rsquo;s mark was
in the psalms, and she began to read to herself.</p>
<p>Joan&rsquo;s face was beneath her blue apron. David&rsquo;s
words did not interpret her at this hour; only her
own lips could speak for her own sorrow and fear.
There was a deep stillness in the house. Outside
the tempest raged wildly. It seemed to Joan as if
hours passed in that interval of heart-trembling;
she was almost shocked when the old clock gave its
long whirring warning and then struck only <i>one</i>.
Her first look was to the fire. It wanted replenishing.
Her next was at Denas. The girl was fast
asleep. Her hands were across the open Bible,
her face was dropped upon them. Joan touched
her and said not unkindly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little bit of Bible-reading do send people to
sleep quick, don&rsquo;t it, Denas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so tired, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear, you be no worse than Christian
in the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.&rsquo; He did go to sleep, too,
when he was reading his roll. Come, my girl, it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
your time for bed. Sitting up won&rsquo;t help you to
bear trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, won&rsquo;t it be time enough to bear trouble
when it is really here to be borne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It do seem as if it would. Love be a fearful
looker-forward. Go to bed, my girl; maybe you
will sleep sorrow away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Denas went to bed and did not awake until the
grey light of the stormy morning was over everything.
She could hear the murmur of voices in the
living-room, and she dressed quickly and went
there. John Penelles sat by the fire drinking hot
tea. His hair had yet bits of ice in it, his face
still had the awful shadow that is cast by the passing-by
of death. Denas put her arms around his
neck and kissed him; she kissed him until she began
to sob, and he drew her upon his knee, and
held her to his breast, and said in a whisper to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten men drowned, my dear, and three frozen to
death; but through God&rsquo;s mercy father slipped away
from an ugly fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, how could you bear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help us, Denas, we must bear what is sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a night it has been! How did you live
through it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dogged as does it and lives through it.
It&rsquo;s dogged as does anything, my dear, all over the
world. I stuck to the boat and the boat stuck to
me. God Almighty Himself can&rsquo;t help a coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storm continued all day, but began to slacken
in intensity at sunset. There was of course no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
service at Pendree. John, even if he had not been
so worn out, could not have reached the place in
such a storm, either by land or sea. But the neighbours,
without seeming premeditation, gathered in
John&rsquo;s cottage at night, and he opened his Bible
and read aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrors take hold on him, as waters; a tempest
stealeth him away in the night. The east wind
carrieth him away, and he departeth; and as a
storm hurleth him out of his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was to these words, with their awful application
to the wicked, that Denas listened the last
night she intended to spend under her father&rsquo;s roof.
John&rsquo;s discourses were nearly always like his
nature, tender and persuasive; and this terrible
sermon wove itself in and out of her wandering
thoughts like a black scroll in a gay vesture. It
pained and troubled her, though she did not consider
why it should do so. After the meeting
was over John was very weary; but he would not
go to bed until he had eaten supper. He &ldquo;wanted
his little maid to sit near him for half-an-hour,&rdquo; he
said. And he held her hand in his own hand, and
gave her such looks of perfect love and blessed
her so solemnly and sweetly when at length he left
her that she began to sob again and to stand on
tiptoe that she might throw her arms around his
neck and touch his lips with hers once more.</p>
<p>Her kisses were wet with her tears, and they made
John&rsquo;s heart soft and gentle as a baby&rsquo;s. &ldquo;She be
the fondest little maid,&rdquo; he said to his wife. &ldquo;She
be the fondest little maid! I could take a whole
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
year to praise her, Joan, and then I could not say
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In reality, the last two days, with their excess of
vital emotions, had worn Denas out. Never before
had the life into which she was born looked so unlovely
to her. She preferred the twitter and twaddle
of Priscilla&rsquo;s workroom to the intense realities
of an existence always verging on eternity. She
dared to contrast those large, heroic fishers, with
their immovable principles and their constant fight
with all the elemental forces for their daily bread,
with Roland Tresham; and to decide that Roland&rsquo;s
delicate beauty, pretty, persuasive manners, and
fashionable clothing were vastly superior attributes.
So she was glad when the morning came, for she
was weary of enduring what need no longer be
endured.</p>
<p>It still rained, but she put on her best clothing,
and Joan was not pleased at her for doing so. She
thought she might come home some night when the
rain was over and change her dress for the visit to
Burrell Court. This difference of opinion made
their last meal together a silent one; for John was
in a deep sleep and Joan would not have him disturbed.
Denas just opened the door and stood a
moment looking at the large, placid face on the
white pillow. As she turned away, it seemed as if
she cut a piece out of her heart; she had a momentary
spasm of real physical pain.</p>
<p>Joan had not yet recovered from her night of terror.
Her face was grey, her eyes heavy, her heart
still beating and aching with some unintelligible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
sense of wrong or grief. And she looked at her
child with such a dumb, sorrowful inquiry that
Denas sat down near her and put her head on her
mother&rsquo;s breast and asked: &ldquo;What is it, mother?
Have I done anything to grieve you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know by, dear. I wish you hadn&rsquo;t
worn your best dress&ndash;&ndash;dresses do cost money, don&rsquo;t
they now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they do, mother. There then! Shall I
take it off? I will, to please you, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! The will be as good as the deed from
my little girl. Maybe you are right, too. Dress
do go a long way to pleasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then good-bye. Kiss me, mother! Kiss me
twice! Kiss me again, for father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Joan kissed her child. She smoothed her hair,
and straightened her collar, and put in a missed
button, and so held her close for a few moments,
and kissed her again; and when Denas had reached
the foot of the cliff, she was still watching her with
the look on her face&ndash;&ndash;the look of a mother who
feels as if she still held her child in her arms.</p>
<p>O love! love! love! Is there any sorrow in
life like loving?</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">It</span> had been raining a little when Denas bade her
mother farewell, but by the time she reached
the top of the cliff the rain had become fog. She
stood still awhile and turned her face to the sea,
and saw one drift after another roll inland, veiling
the beach, and the boats, and the cottages, and
leaving the whole scene a spectacle of desolation.</p>
<p>It affected her painfully. The love and hope in
her heart did not lift her above the depressing
influence of that mournful last view of her home.
Was the thing that she was going to do worth while?
Was anything in life worth while? The little town
had a half-awakened Monday-morning look. Every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
one seemed to be beginning another week with an
&ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo; sort of feeling. Miss Priscilla was
just dressing her shop window, and as cross as crossed
sticks over her employment. She said that Denas
was late, and wondered &ldquo;for goodness&rsquo; sake why
she was so dressed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave Denas a kind of spiteful pleasure to answer:
&ldquo;She was dressed to go to Burrell Court and
spend a day with Mrs. Burrell. When she sent Mr.
Burrell word the day she would come the carriage
would call for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean the day I can spare you best, I cannot
spare you at all this week. There now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not thinking of you sparing me, Priscilla.
I am waiting for a fine day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word! Am I your mistress or are
you mine? And what is more, that Roland Tresham
is not coming here again. I have some conscience,
thank goodness! and I will not sanction such ways
and such carryings on any longer. He is a dishonourable
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he not paid you, Priscilla?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Priscilla could find the scathing words she
required, an hostler from the Black Lion entered
the shop and put a letter into the hand of Denas.</p>
<p>Priscilla turned angrily on the man and ordered
him to leave her shop directly. Then she said:
&ldquo;Denas Penelles, you are a bad girl! I am going
to write to Mrs. Burrell this day, and to your father
and mother also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not be a fool if I was you, Priscilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas was reading the letter, and softly smiling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
as she uttered the careless words. For indeed
affairs were at a point now where Priscilla&rsquo;s interference
would hurt herself more than others. The
note was, of course, from Roland. It told her that
all was ready, and that the weather being so bad as
to render walking very tiresome and miserable, he
had engaged a carriage which would be waiting for
her on the west side of the parish church at seven
o&rsquo;clock that night; and her lover would be waiting
with it, and if Roland was to be believed, everything
joyful and marvellous was waiting also.</p>
<p>This letter was the only sunshine throughout the
day. Priscilla&rsquo;s bad temper was in the ascendant,
both in the shop and in the workroom. She scolded
Denas for working so slowly, she made her unrip
whatever she did. She talked at Denas in talking
to the other girls, and the girls all echoed and
shadowed their mistress&rsquo; opinions and conduct.
Denas smiled, and her smile had in it a mysterious
satisfaction which all felt to be offensive. But for
the certain advent of seven o&rsquo;clock, the day would
have been intolerable.</p>
<p>About half-past six she put on her hat and cloak,
and Miss Priscilla ordered her to take them off.
&ldquo;You are not going outside my house to-night,
Denas Penelles,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If you sew until ten
o&rsquo;clock, you will not have done a day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going home, Priscilla. I will work for
you no more. You have behaved shamefully to me
all day, and I am going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla had not calculated on such a result, and
it was inconvenient to her. She began to talk more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
reasonably, but Denas would listen to no apology.
It suited her plans precisely to leave Priscilla in
anger, for if Priscilla thought she had gone home
she would not of course send any word to her parents.
So she left the workroom in a pretended passion,
and shut the shop door after her with a clash that
made Miss Priscilla give a little scream and the
forewoman ejaculate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there then! A good riddance of such a
bad piece! I do say that for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very little did Denas care for the opinions of
Priscilla and her work-maidens. She knew that the
word of any girl there could be bought for a day&rsquo;s
wage; she was as willing they should speak evil as
well of her. Yet it was with a heart full of anger at
the day&rsquo;s petty slights and wrongs that she hastened
to the place mentioned by Roland. As she turned
into the street at one end the carriage entered it at
the other. It came to meet her; it stopped, and
Roland leaped to her side. In another moment she
was in the carriage. Roland&rsquo;s arm was around her;
he was telling her how grateful he was; how happy!
how proud! He was promising her a thousand
pleasures, giving her hope after hope; vowing an
unalterable and never-ending love.</p>
<p>And Denas surrendered herself to his charm.
After the last three dreadful days, it did seem a
kind of heaven to be taken right out of a life so
hard and unlovely and so full of painful emotions;
to be kissed and flattered and to be treated like a
lady. The four miles she had expected to walk
went like a happy dream; she was sorry when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
were passed and the bare railway station was
reached. It was but a small place lit by a single
lamp, but Roland improvised a kind of couch, and
told her to sleep while he watched and smoked a
cigar.</p>
<p>In a short time he returned, and said that there
was no train to Plymouth until midnight; but an
express for London would pass in half an hour, and
they had better take it. Denas thought a moment,
and answered with a decision that made Roland look
curiously at her: &ldquo;No. I will not go to London
to be married. I know the preacher at Plymouth.
We will wait for the Plymouth train.&rdquo; It was not
a very pleasant wait. It was cold and damp and
inexpressibly dreary, and Roland could not avoid
showing that he was disappointed in not taking the
London train.</p>
<p>But the hours go by, no matter to what measure,
and midnight came, and the train came, and the
comfort and privacy of a first-class carriage restored
the lover-like attitude of the runaways. Early in
the morning they reached Plymouth, and as soon as
possible they sought the house of the Wesleyan
preacher. It stood close to the chapel and was
readily found. A written message on Roland&rsquo;s
card brought him at once to the parlour. He looked
with interest and curiosity and some disapproval
at the couple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tresham,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the card
which he held in his hand, &ldquo;you wish me to marry
you. I think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He was going to make some
inquiries or objections, but he caught the expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
of anxiety in the face of Denas, and then he
looked carefully at her and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I not seen you before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, when you preached at St. Penfer last
summer. I am the daughter of John Penelles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fisher Penelles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Yes, Mr. Tresham, I will marry you at
once. It will be the best thing, under the circumstances,
I am sure. Follow me, sir.&rdquo; As they went
along a narrow covered way, he called a servant and
gave her an order, and then opening a door ushered
the would-be bride and bridegroom into the chapel,
and straight to the communion rail.</p>
<p>Denas knelt down there, and for a few moments
lost herself in sincere prayer. After all, in great
emotion prayer was her native tongue. When she
stood up and lifted her eyes, the preacher&rsquo;s wife
and two daughters were at her side, and the preacher
himself was at the communion table, with the open
book in his hand. The bare chapel in the grey daylight;
the strange tones of the preacher&rsquo;s voice in
the empty place; the strange women at her side&ndash;&ndash;it
was all like a dream. She felt afraid to move or
to look up. She answered as she was told, and she
heard Roland answer also. But his voice did not
sound real and happy, and when he took the plain
gold ring from the preacher&rsquo;s hand and said after
him, &ldquo;With this ring I thee wed,&rdquo; she raised her
eyes to her husband&rsquo;s face. It was pale and sombre.
No answering flash of love met hers, and she
felt it difficult to restrain her tears.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>In truth, Roland was smitten with a sudden irresolution
that was almost regret. As Denas knelt
praying, there had come to his mind many a dream
he had had of his own wedding. He had always
thought of it in some old church that would be made
to glow with bride-roses and ring with bride-music.
Young maidens and men of high degree
were to tread the wedding march with him. Dancing
and feasting, gay company and rich presents,
were to add glory to some fair girl wife, whom he
would choose because, of all others, she was the
loveliest; and the wealthiest, and the most to be
desired.</p>
<p>And then his eyes fell upon the girl at his feet,
in her plain dark dress crushed and disordered with
a night&rsquo;s travel; the bare, empty chapel; the utter
want of music, flowers, company, or social support
of any kind; the small, rigid-looking preacher without
surplice or insignia of holy office; the half-expressed
disapproval on the countenances of the three
women present as witnesses&ndash;&ndash;it was not thus Elizabeth
was married; it was not thus he himself ought
to have been married. How the surroundings might
affect Denas he did not even think; and yet the
poor girl also had had her dreams, which this cold,
dreary reality in no measure redeemed.</p>
<p>But the ring was on her finger; she was Roland&rsquo;s
wife. Nothing could ever make her less. She
heard the preacher say: &ldquo;Come into the vestry, Mrs.
Tresham, and sign the register.&rdquo; And then Roland
gave her his arm and kissed her, and she went with
the little company, and took the pen from her husband&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
hand, and wrote boldly for the last time her
maiden name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denasia Penelles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland looked inquiringly at her, and she smiled
and answered: &ldquo;That is right, dear. I was christened
Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very small things pleased Roland, and the new
name delighted him. All the way to London he
spoke frequently of it. &ldquo;You are now Denasia, my
darling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let the old name slip with
the old life. Besides, Denasia is an excellent public
name. You can sing under it splendidly. Such
a noble name! Why did you let everyone spoil it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone thought Denas was my name. Father
and mother always called me Denas, and people
forgot that it was only part of my name. Fisher-folk
have short names, or nicknames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, really, Denasia Penelles is a very distinguished
name. A splendid one for the public.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not Denasia Tresham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, my dear, there are Treshams living in
London who would be very angry at me if I put
their name on a bill-board. The Treshams are a
very proud family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland, it would kill my father if I put his
name on anything that refers to a theatre. You
don&rsquo;t know how he feels on that subject. It is a
thing of life and death&ndash;&ndash;I mean the soul&rsquo;s life or
death&ndash;&ndash;to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A painful discussion, in which both felt hurt and
angry and both spoke in very affectionate terms,
followed. It lasted until they reached the great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
city which stretches out her hands to every other
city. Roland had secured rooms in a very dull,
respectable house in Queen&rsquo;s Square, Bloomsbury.
He had often stayed there when his finances did not
admit of West End luxuries, and the place was suitable
for many other reasons.</p>
<p>Then followed two perfectly happy weeks for
Denas. She had written a few lines to her parents
while waiting for a train at Exeter, and she then
resolved not to permit herself to grieve about their
grief, because it could do them no good and it
would seriously worry and annoy Roland. And
Roland was so loving and generous. At his command
modistes and milliners turned his plebeian
bride into a fashionable, and certainly into a very
lovely lady. She had more pretty costumes than she
had ever dreamed of; she had walking-hats and
dress-hats, and expensive furs, and she grew more
beautiful with each new garment. They went to
theatres and operas; they went riding and walking;
they had cosey little dinners at handsome restaurants;
and Roland never once named money, or singing,
or anything likely to spoil the charm of the life
they were leading.</p>
<p>During this happy interval Denas did not quite
forget her parents. She wrote to them once, and she
very often wondered through whom and in what
manner they received the news of their loss. It
was her own hand which dealt the blow. Miss Priscilla
really thought Denas had gone back to her
home, and she resolved on the following Sunday
afternoon to walk down to the fishing village and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
&ldquo;make it up&rdquo; with her. About Wednesday, however,
there began to be floating rumours of the
truth. Several people called on Priscilla and asked
after the whereabouts of Denas; and the landlord
of the Black Lion was talking freely of the large
bill Roland had left unsettled there. But none of
these rumours reached the ears of the fisher-folk,
nor were they likely to do so until the St. Penfer
<i>Weekly News</i> appeared. The first three days of the
week had been so foggy that no boat had cared to
risk a sail over the bar; but on Thursday morning
all was clear, and the men were eager to get out to
sea. John Penelles was hastening toward his boat,
when he heard a voice calling him. It was the
postman, and he turned and went to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be a letter for you, John Penelles. Exeter
postmark. I came a bit out of my way with it. I
thought you would be looking for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was thinking of Denas and the reports
about her flight; but John&rsquo;s unconcern puzzled him,
and he did not care to say anything more definite
to the big fisherman. And, as it happened, a letter
was expected from Plymouth, on chapel business;
for the very preacher who had married Roland and
Denas had been asked to come to St. Penfer and
preach the yearly missionary sermon. John had no
doubt this letter from Exeter referred to the matter.
He said so to the postman, and with the unconscious
messenger of sorrow in his hand went back to his
cottage.</p>
<p>For letters were unusual events with John. If this
referred to the missionary service, he would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
to read it in public next Sunday, and he was much
pleased and astonished that it should have been
sent to him. He felt a certain importance in the
event, and was anxious to share his little triumph
with his &ldquo;old dear.&rdquo; Joan did not quite appreciate
his consideration. She had her hands in the dough,
and her thoughts were upon the pipeclaying which
she was going to give to the flagged floor of her cottage.
She had hoped men-folks with their big
boots would keep away until her work was dry and
snow-white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be a letter from Exeter, Joan, to me.
&rsquo;Twill be about the missionary service. I thought
you would like to know, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hum-m-m!</i>&rdquo; answered Joan. &ldquo;I could have
done without the news, John, till the bread was
baked and the floor was whitened.&rdquo; She had her
back to John, but, as he did not speak again, she
turned her face over her shoulder and looked at
him. The next moment she was at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, John? John Penelles, speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John stood on the hearth with his left arm outstretched
and holding an open letter. His eyes were
fixed on it. His face had the rigid, stubborn look
of a man who on the very point of unconsciousness
arrests his soul by a peremptory act of will. He
stood erect, stiff, speechless, with the miserable slip
of white paper at the end of his outstretched arm.</p>
<p>Joan gently forced him back into his chair; she
untied his many neckcloths; she bared his broad,
hairy chest; she brought him water to drink; and
at length her tears and entreaties melted the stone-like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
rigour; his head fell forward, his eyes closed,
his hand unclasped, and the letter fell to the floor.
It did not interest Joan; nothing on earth was of
interest to her while her husband was in that horror
of stubborn suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John,&rdquo; she whispered, with her face against his
face&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;John! My John! My good heart, be yourself
and tell Joan what is the matter. Is it sickness
of your body, John? Is it trouble of your
mind, John? Be a man, and speak to God and to
me. God is our refuge and our strength&ndash;&ndash;think o&rsquo;
that. A very present help in trouble&ndash;&ndash;present,
not a long way off, John, not in heaven; but here
in your heart and on your hearth. Oh, John! John!
do speak to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Joan! The letter, dear; read it&ndash;&ndash;read
it aloud&ndash;&ndash;I may be mistaken&ndash;&ndash;it isn&rsquo;t possible,
I&rsquo;m sure. God help us both!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan lifted the letter and read aloud the words
written so hastily in a few moments of time, but
which brought to two loving hearts years of anxious
sorrow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Father and Mother</span>:&ndash;&ndash;I have just
been married to Roland Tresham, and we are on our
way to London. I love Roland so much, I hope
you will forgive me. I will write more from London.
Your loving child,</p>
<p class='closing sig2'>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class='smcap'>Denas Tresham</span>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joan, my dear! My heart be broken! My
heart be broken! My heart be broken!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, John, don&rsquo;t you be saying such wisht dismal,
ugly words. A heart like yours is hard to
break. Not even a bad daughter can do it. Oh,
my dear, don&rsquo;t you talk like that there! Don&rsquo;t,
John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the Lord&rsquo;s will, Joan&ndash;&ndash;I do know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be nothing of the kind, John. It be the
devil&rsquo;s will when a child do wrong such love as
yours and mine. And there, now! Will you break
your brave old heart, that has faced death a hundred
times, for the devil? No, &rsquo;tis not like to be, I&rsquo;m
sure. Look at the worst of it. Denas does say she
be married. She does write her name with his
name. What then? Many a poor father and mother
have drunk the cup we be drinking&ndash;&ndash;nothing strange
have come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe she be the man&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear, I do believe it. And Denas be
my daughter, and I will not let you or any other
man say but that she be all of an honest woman.
&rsquo;Tis slander against your awn flesh and blood to say
different, John.&rdquo; And Joan spoke so warmly that
her temper had a good effect upon her husband. It
was like a fresh sea-breeze. He roused himself and
sat upright, and began to listen to his wife&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas be gone away&ndash;&ndash;gone away for ever from
us&ndash;&ndash;never more our little maid&ndash;&ndash;never more! All
this be true. But, John, her heart was gone a long
time ago. Our poor ways were her scorn; she have
gone to her awn, my dear, and we could not keep
her. &rsquo;Tis like the young gull you brought home
one day, and, when it was grown, no love kept it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
from the sea. You gave it of your best, and it left
you; it lay in your breast, John, and it left you.
My dear! my dear! she be the man&rsquo;s wife. Say
that and feel that and stick to that. He be no
son to us, that be sure; but Denas is our daughter.
And maybe, John, things are going to turn out
better than you think for. Denas be no fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Joan, how could she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Joan broke down and began to sob
passionately, and John had to turn comforter.
And thus the painful hours went by, and the bread
was not baked, and the boats went to sea without
John; and the two sorrowful hearts sat together on
their lonely hearth and talked of the child who
had run away from their love. They were uncertain
what to say to their neighbours, uncertain what their
neighbours would say to them. John thought he
ought to go to Exeter and see all the clergymen
there, and so find out if Denas had been lawfully
married. Joan thought it &ldquo;a wisht poor business
to go looking for bad news. Sit at your fireside,
old man, or go far out to sea if you like it better,
and if bad news be for you it will find you out, do
be sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day it did find them out. The St. Penfer
<i>News</i>, published on Thursday, which was market-day,
contained the following item: &ldquo;On Monday
night the daughter of John Penelles, fisher, ran
off with Mr. Roland Tresham. The guilty pair went
direct to London. Great sympathy is felt for the
girl&rsquo;s father, who is a thoroughly upright man and
a Wesleyan local preacher of the St. Penfer circuit.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></div>
<p>One of the brethren thought it his duty to show
this paragraph to John. And the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; in
John gained the mastery, and with a great oath he
swore the words were a lie. Then, being sneeringly
contradicted, he felled &ldquo;the man of duty&rdquo; prone
upon the shingle. Then he went home and thoroughly
terrified Joan. The repressed animal passion
of a lifetime raged in him like a wild beast. He
used words which horrified his wife, he kicked
chairs and tables out of his way like a man drunk
with strong liquor. He said he would go to St.
Merryn&rsquo;s and get his money, and follow Roland
and Denas to the end of the world; and if they were
not married, they should marry or die&ndash;&ndash;both of
them. He walked his cottage floor the night
through, and all the powers of darkness tortured
and tempted him.</p>
<p>For the first time in all their wedded life Joan
dared not approach her husband. He was like a
giant in the power of his enemies, and his struggles
were terrible. But she knew well that he must fight
and conquer alone. Hour after hour his ceaseless
tramp, tramp, tramp went on; and she could hear
him breathing inwardly like one who has business
of life and death in hand.</p>
<p>Toward dawn she lost hold of herself and fell
asleep. When she awoke it was broad daylight,
and all was still in the miserable house. Softly she
opened the door and looked into the living-room.
John was on his knees; she heard his voice&ndash;&ndash;a far-off,
awful voice&ndash;&ndash;the voice of the soul and not of
the body. So she went back, and with bowed head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
sat down on the edge of her bed and waited. Very
cold was the winter morning, but she feared to
make a movement. She knew it was long past the
breakfast hour; she heard footsteps passing, the
shouts of the fishers, the cries of the sea-birds; she
believed it to be at least ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>But she sat breathlessly still. John was wrestling
as Jacob wrestled; a movement, a whisper might
delay the victory or the blessing. She almost held
her breath as the muttered pleading grew more and
more rapid, more and more urgent. Then there
was a dead silence, a pause, a long deep sigh, a
slow movement&ndash;&ndash;and John opened the door and said
softly, &ldquo;Joan.&rdquo; There was the light of victory on
his face; the cold strong light of a lifted sword.
Then he sat down by her side; but what he told her
and how she comforted him belong to those sacred,
secret things which it is a sacrilege against love to
speak of.</p>
<p>They went together to the cold hearth, and kindled
the fire, and made the meal both urgently
needed, and, as they ate it, John spoke of the duty
before him. He had sworn at Jacob Trenager and
knocked him down; he had let loose all the devils
within him; he had failed in the hour of his trial,
and he must resign his offices of class leader and
local preacher.</p>
<p>It was a bitter personal humiliation. How his
enemies would rejoice! Where he had been first, he
must be last. After he had eaten, he took the plan
out of the Bible and looked at it. As he already
knew, he was appointed to preach at St. Clair the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
following evening. He had prepared his sermon
on those three foggy days that began the week.
He then thought he had never been so ready for a
preaching, and he had the desire of a natural orator
for his occasion. But how could he preach to others
when he had failed himself? The flight of his
daughter was in every mouth, and in some measure
he would be held responsible for her sin. Was not
Eli punished for his son&rsquo;s transgressions? The duty
before him was a terrible one. It made his brown
face blanch and his strong, stern mouth <a name='TC_5'></a><ins title="Was 'guiver'">quiver</ins> with
mental anguish.</p>
<p>But he laid the plan on the table and crossed out
carefully all the figures which represented John
Penelles. Then he wrote a few lines to the superintendent
and enclosed his self-degradation. Joan
wondered what he would do about the St. Clair
appointment, for he had asked no one to take his
place, and early in the afternoon he told her to get
the lantern ready, as he was going there. She divined
what he purposed to do, and she refused to go with
him. He did not oppose her decision; perhaps he
was glad she felt able to spare herself and him
the extra humiliation.</p>
<p>Never had the little chapel been so crowded. All
his mates from the neighbouring villages were present;
for everyone had some share of that itching
curiosity that likes to see how a soul suffers. A
few of the leaders spoke to him; a great many
appeared to be lost in those divine meditations
suitable to the house of worship. John&rsquo;s first action
awakened everyone present to a sense of something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
unusual. He refused to ascend the pulpit. He
passed within the rails that enclosed the narrow
sacred spot below the pulpit, drew the small table
forward, and, without the preface of hymn or prayer,
plunged at once into his own confession of unworthiness
to minister to them. He read aloud the letter
which he had received from his daughter, and averred
his belief in its truthfulness. He told, with the minutest
veracity, every word of his quarrel with Jacob
Trenager. He confessed his shameful and violent
temper in his own home; his hatred and his desire
and purposes of revenge; and he asked the pardon
of Trenager and of every member of the church
which had been scandalized by the action of his
daughter and by his own sinfulness.</p>
<p>His voice, sad and visibly restrained by a powerful
will, throbbed with the burning emotions which
made the man quiver from head to feet. It was
impossible not to feel something of the anguish that
looked out of his large patient eyes and trembled
on his lips. Women began to sob hysterically, men
bent their heads low or covered their faces with
their hands; an irresistible wave of sorrow and
sympathy was carrying every soul with it.</p>
<p>But, even while John was speaking, a man rose
and walked up the aisle to the table at which John
stood. He turned his face to the congregation, and,
lifting up his big hand, cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, John Penelles. I be to blame in this
matter. I be the villain! There isn&rsquo;t a Cornishman
living that be such a Judas as I be. &rsquo;Twas
under my old boat Denas Penelles found the love-letters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
that couldn&rsquo;t have come to her own home.
Why did I lend my boat and myself for such a
cruel bad end? Was it because I liked the young
man? No, I hated him. What for, then?&rdquo; He put
his hand in his pocket, took out a piece of gold,
and, in the sight of all, dashed it down on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I did it for. One pound! A wisht
beggarly bit of money! Judas asked thirty pieces.
I sold Paul Pyn for one piece, and it was too much&ndash;&ndash;too
much for such a ghastly, mean old rascal. I
be cruel sorry&ndash;&ndash;but there then! where be the good
of &lsquo;sorry&rsquo; now? That bit of gold have burnt my
soul blacker than a coal! dreadful! aw, dreadful!
I wouldn&rsquo;t touch it again to save my mean old
life. And if there be a man or a woman in Cornwall
that will touch it, they be as uncommon bad as
I be! that is sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul, I forgive you, and there is my hand upon
it. A man can only be &lsquo;sorry.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sorry&rsquo; be all that
God asks,&rdquo; said John Penelles in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be no man, John. I be just a cruel bad fellow.
I never had a child to love me or one to love. No
woman would be my wife. I be kind of forsaken&ndash;&ndash;no
kith or kin to care about me,&rdquo; and, with his
brown, rugged face cast down, he began to walk
toward the door. Then Ann Bude rose in the sight
of all. She went to his side; she took his hand
and passed out of the chapel with him. And everyone
looked at the other, for Paul had loved Ann
for twenty years and twenty times at least Ann
had refused to be his wife. But now, in this hour
of his shame and sorrow, she had gone to his side,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
and a sigh and a smile passed from heart to heart
and from face to face.</p>
<p>John stood still, with his eyes fixed on the piece
of gold. It lay on the table like a guilty thing.
All Pyn&rsquo;s sin seemed to have passed into it. Men
and women stood up to look at it where it lay&ndash;&ndash;the
wretched tool of a bad man. It was a relief
when Jacob Trenager gave out a hymn, a greater
relief that John Penelles went out while they were
singing it. Brothers and sisters all wished to talk
about John and John&rsquo;s trouble, but to talk to him
in his grief and humiliation was a different thing.
Only the old chapel-keeper watched him going
along the rocky coast at a dangerous speed, his lantern
swinging wildly to his big strides.</p>
<p>But a five-minutes&rsquo; walk brought John to a place
where he was alone with God and the sea. Oh,
then, how he cried out for pity! for comfort! for
help! for forgiveness! His voice was not the
inaudible pleading of a man praying in his chamber;
it was like the despairing call of a strong swimmer
in the death-billows. It went out over the ocean;
it went out beyond time and space; it touched the
heart of the Divinity who pitieth the sufferers,
&ldquo;even as a father pitieth his children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a glow of firelight through his cottage
window, but no candle. Joan was bending sorrowfully
over the red coals. John was glad of the dim
light, glad of the quiet, glad of the solitude, for
Joan was only his other self&ndash;&ndash;his sweeter and more
hopeful self. He told her all that had passed. She
stood up beside him, she held his head against her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
breast and let him sob away there the weight of
grief and shame that almost choked him. Then
she spoke bravely to the broken-down, weary man:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John, my old dear, don&rsquo;t you sit on the ash-heap
like Job, and bemoan yourself and your birthday,
and go on as if the devil had more to do with you
than with other Christians. Speak up to your
Heavenly Father, and ask Him &lsquo;why,&rsquo; and answer
Him like a man; do now! And go to Exeter in the
morning, and make yourself sure that Denas be a
honest woman. I, her mother, be sure of it; but
there then! men do be so bad themselves, they can&rsquo;t
trust their own hearts, nor their own ears and eyes.
&lsquo;I believe&rsquo; will make a woman happy; but a man,
God knows, they must go to the law and the testimony,
or they are not satisfied. It&rsquo;s dreadful!
dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked the night away, and early in the
morning John went to Exeter. With the proofs of
his daughter&rsquo;s marriage in his hand, he felt as if he
could face his enemies. Joan was equal to them
without it. She knew they would find her out, and
they found her singing at her work. Her placid
face and cheery words of welcome nonplussed the
most spiteful; the majority who came to triumph
over her went away without being able to say one
of the many evil thoughts in their hearts; and not
a few found themselves hoping and wishing good
things for the bride.</p>
<p>But it was a great effort, and many times that
day Joan went into the inner room, and buried her
face in her pillow, and had her cry out. Only she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
confidently expected John to bring back the proofs
of her child&rsquo;s marriage, and in that expectation she
bore without weakening the slant eye, and the
shrugged shoulder, and the denying looks of her
neighbours. And of course John found no minister
in Exeter who had married Denas Penelles and
Roland Tresham; and it never once struck him that
Denas had been married in Plymouth and found no
time to write until she reached Exeter. Neither
did Joan think of such a possibility; yet when her
husband came in without a word and sat down
with a black, stubborn face, she knew that he had
been disappointed.</p>
<p>That night John held his peace, even from good;
and Joan felt that for once she must do the same.
So they sat together without candle, without speech,
bowed to the earth with shame, feeling with bitter
anguish that their old age had been beggared of
love, and honour, and hope, and happiness; and,
alas! so beggared by the child who had been the
joy and the pride of their lives.</p>
<p>At the same hour Denas sat with Roland in one of
the fine restaurants to be found in High Holborn.
They had eaten of the richest viands, the sparkle
of the champagne cup was in both their eyes, and
they were going anon to the opera. Denas had a
silk robe on and a little pink opera cloak. Her
long pale gloves and her bouquet of white roses
were by her side. Roland was in full evening dress.
Their eyes flashed; their cheeks flamed with pleasant
anticipations. They rose from their dinner with
smiles and whispered love-words; and Roland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
ordered with the air of a lord, &ldquo;A carriage for the
opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From John and Joan these events were mercifully
hidden. It is only God who can bear the awful
light of omniscience and of omnipresence. The
things we cannot see! The things we never know!
Let us be unspeakably grateful for this blessed
ignorance! For many a heart would break that
lives on if it only knew&ndash;&ndash;if it only saw&ndash;&ndash;how unnecessary
was its love to those it loves so fondly!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>A PIECE OF MONEY AND A SONG.</h3>
</div>
<table summary=''><tr><td>

<p>&ldquo;Tis but a Judas coin, though it be gold;</p>

<p>So just, so small, yet in so sweet a note,</p>
<p>It seemed the music melted in the throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p class='ralign'>&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>Dryden.</span></p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> piece of money left by Pyn might have been
a curse; no one would touch it. While the
women stood in groups talking of poor John Penelles
and Denas, the men held an informal meeting around
the table on which it lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This be the communion table,&rdquo; said Jacob Trenager;
&ldquo;some one ought to take the money off it.
And I think it be best to carry the gold to the superintendent;
he will tell us what to do with it;&rdquo; and,
after some objections, Jacob took charge of the sinful
coin, and the next morning he went up the cliff
to St. Penfer with it.</p>
<p>The preacher heard the story with an intense
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
interest. &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I suppose there
be none so poor in your village as to feel it might
do them good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, nor woman, nor child, would buy a loaf
with it, sir; none of us men would let them. If
Denas Penelles have gone out of the way, sir, she
be a fisher&rsquo;s daughter, and the man and the money
that beguiled her be hateful to all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your chapel&ndash;&ndash;is it not very poor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not poor enough to take the devil&rsquo;s coin, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jacob, I cannot say that I feel any more
disposed to use it than you do. We know it was
the wage of sin, and neither the service of God nor
the poor will be the better for it. I think we will
give it back to the young man. It may help to
show him how his fellows regard the thing he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be the best way of all, sir. But he be in
London, and hard to find no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take it to his sister. I do not hold her
quite guiltless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Jacob threw the sovereign on the preacher&rsquo;s
desk, and it lay on the green baize, a yellow, evil-looking
thing. For men love to make their thoughts
palpable to their senses, and this bit of gold was
visible sin&ndash;&ndash;part of the price of a desolated home.</p>
<p>It was singular to see this same personification
troubling the educated preacher as well as the
unlearned fisherman. The Rev. William Farrar,
when left alone with the unwelcome coin, looked
askance at it. He did not like to see it on his desk,
he had a repugnance to touch it. Then he forced
himself to lift the sovereign, and by an elaborate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
fingering of the coin convince his intellect that he
had no foolish superstition on the subject. Anon
he took out his purse for its safe keeping, but suddenly,
after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, he snapped the
clasp tight, and threw the bit of money on the chimney-piece.
For a momentary flash of thought had
brought vividly before him the sinful Babylonish
garment which troubled the camp of Israel. Perhaps
that sinful money might be equally malign to
his own household.</p>
<p>He had resolved to take it to Mrs. Burrell in
the afternoon, for the morning was his time for
study and writing. But he found it impossible to
think of his sermon. That sovereign on the mantelpiece
was in all his thoughts. His back was to it,
and yet he saw the dull shining disc. In spite of
his reason and his faith, in spite of a very strong
will and of a practiced command over himself, he
felt the presence of the rejected coin to be a weight
and an influence he could not pretend to ignore.</p>
<p>So he resolved to leave every other duty and go
to Burrell Court, though it was a long walk, and
the thick misty Cornish rain had begun to fall.
Indeed, there was nothing but a vapourish shroud, a
dim, grey chaos, as far as his eye could reach. The
strip of road on which he trod was apparently the
only land left to tread on&ndash;&ndash;all the rest of creation
had disappeared in a spectral mist. But above the
mist the lark was singing joyously, singing for the
song&rsquo;s sake, and the melody went down into his
heart and preached him a better sermon than he
was ever likely to write.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></div>
<p>Listening to it, he reached, before he was aware,
the great gates of the Court. Mrs. Burrell was at
home, and he sent a request for an interview. Elizabeth
instantly suspected that he had come on some
affair relating to that wretched business. She was
in trouble enough about it, but she was also proud
and reticent, and not inclined to discuss Roland
with a stranger.</p>
<p>Quite intentionally she gave to her manner a good
deal of that haughtiness which young wives think
dignity, but which is in reality the offensive freshness
of new-made honour. The preacher offered her
his hand, but she did not see it, being fully occupied
in arranging the long train of cashmere, silk, and
lace which, in those days, made morning dresses a
misnomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Wesleyan preacher from St. Penfer,
Mrs. Burrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I do anything for you, sir? though really, if
yours is a charitable visit, I must remind you that my
own church looks to me for all I can possibly afford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not come, Mrs. Burrell, to ask for money.
I bring you this sovereign, which belongs to Mr.
Roland Tresham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gold fell from his fingers, spun round a few
times, and, dropping upon the polished mahogany
table, made a distinct clink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you, Mr. Farrar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preacher hastened to make the circumstance
more intelligible. He related the scene at the St.
Clair chapel with a dramatic force that sprang from
intense feeling, and Elizabeth listened to his solemn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
words with angry uneasiness. Yet she made an
effort to treat the affair with unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I to do with the sovereign, sir?&rdquo; she
asked. &ldquo;I am not responsible for Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s
acts. I did my best to prevent the disgrace that
has befallen the fisherman&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are to blame in a great measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I am sure you are. You made a companion
of the girl&ndash;&ndash;I may say a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not a friend. She was not my equal in
any respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say a companion then. You taught her how to
dress, how to converse, how to carry herself above
her own class. You permitted her to wander about
the garden with your brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always watched them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You let her talk to him&ndash;&ndash;you let her sing with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never but when I was present. From the first
I told her what Roland was&ndash;&ndash;told her to mind
nothing at all he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had put a glass of cold water before a
man dying of thirst, would you have been justified
in telling him not to drink? You might even have
added that the water contained poison; all the same,
he would have drunk it, and your blame it would be
for putting it within his reach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Mr. Farrar, I will not take the blame of
the creature&rsquo;s wickedness. It is a strange thing to
be told that educating a girl and trying to lift her
a step or two higher is a sin.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sin, madam, unless you persevere in it.
God does not permit the rich, for their own temporary
glory or convenience, to make experiments
with an immortal soul, and then abandon it like a
soiled glove or a game of which they have grown
weary. What you began you ought in common
justice to have carried on to such perfection as was
possible. No circumstances could justify you in
beguiling a girl from her natural protectors and
then leaving her in the midst of danger alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, this is my affair, not yours. I beg leave
to say that you know nothing whatever of the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I know a great deal about them, and I
can reasonably deduce a great deal more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, sir, what do you deduce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right of Denas Penelles to have been retained
as your companion. Having made a certain refinement
of life necessary to her, you ought in common
justice to have supplied the want you created.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this trouble arose when I was on my wedding-trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to have taken her with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. It was hard to be suddenly deprived
of every social pleasure and refinement and sent
back to a fisher&rsquo;s cottage to cure fish, and knot nets,
and knit fishing-shirts. How could you have
borne it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Farrar, such a comparison is an insult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean no insult; far from it. Even my office
would give me no right to insult you. I only wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
to awaken your conscience. Even yet it may take
up your abandoned duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you do not know that I endeavoured last
week to see Denas. I wrote to her. I asked her to
come and see me. I told her I wanted to talk with
her about Mr. Tresham. She did not even answer
my letter. I consider myself clear of the ungrateful
girl&ndash;&ndash;and as I am busy this morning I will be
obliged to you, sir, to excuse my further attendance.
Take the sovereign with you; give it to the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God will feed His poor, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a little scornful laugh and asked: &ldquo;Do
you really inquire into the character of all the
money your church receives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No further, madam, than you inquire into the
character of the visitors you receive. Plenty of
thieves and seducers are in every society, but it is
not until a man is publicly known to be a thief or
a seducer that we are justified in refusing him a
courteous reception. A great deal of money is the
wages of sin, and it passes through our hands and
we are not stained by its contact; but if I give you
a piece of gold and say, &lsquo;It is the price of a slain
soul, or a slain body, or a slain reputation,&rsquo; would
you like to put it in your purse, or buy bread for
your children with it, or take it to church and offer
it to God? I wish you good-morning, Mrs. Burrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Elizabeth bowed and stood watching him
until the door was closed and she was alone with
the coin. It offended her. It had been the cause
of a most humiliating visit. She looked at it with
scorn and loathing. A servant entered with a card;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
she took it eagerly, and pointing to the money
said, &ldquo;Carry it to Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s room and lay it
upon the dressing-table.&rdquo; She was grateful to get
it out of her sight, and very glad indeed to see the
visitor who had given her such a prompt opportunity
for ridding her eyes of its gleaming presence.</p>
<p>Thus it is that not only present but absent personalities
rule us. In St. Penfer, Paul Pyn and
Ann Bude, John and Joan Penelles, the Rev. Mr.
Farrar and Mrs. Burrell, were all that morning governed
in some degree by Roland&rsquo;s evilly spent sovereign;
and he far off in London was in the hey-day
of his honeymoon with Denas. They were so gay,
so thoughtless and happy that people turned to look
at them as they wandered through the bazars or
stood laughing before the splendid windows in
Regent Street. Many an old man and woman smiled
sympathetically at them; for all the world loves a
lover, and none could tell that these lovers had forfeited
their right to sympathy by stealing their
pleasure from those who ought to have shared it
with them.</p>
<p>But as yet the world was only an accident of their
love, and there was a whole week before them of
unbroken and unsatiated delight&ndash;&ndash;a whole week in
which neither of them thought of the past or the
future; in which every hour brought a fresh pleasure,
something new to wear, or to see, or to hear. If it
could only have lasted! Alas! the ability to enjoy
went first. Amusements of every kind grew a little&ndash;&ndash;a
very little&ndash;&ndash;tiresome. The first glory was dimmed;
the charm of freshness was duller; the unreasoning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
delight of ignorance a little less enthusiastic every
day; and about the close of the third week Roland
said one morning, &ldquo;You look weary, Denasia, my
darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired, Roland&ndash;&ndash;tired of going a-pleasuring.
I never thought anything like that could possibly
happen. Ought I not to be taking lessons, learning
something, doing something about my voice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is high time, love. Money melts in London
like ice in summer. Suppose we go and see Signor
Maria this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to go very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make yourself very fine and very pretty,
and let me hear if your voice is in good order
to-day.&rdquo; He went to the piano and struck a few
chords, and throughout the still, decorous house,
people in every room heard the sweet voice chanting:</p>

<p>and up and down stairs doors were softly opened,
and through every heart there went a breath of the
salt sea and a longing for the wide stretches of
rippled sands and tossing blue waters.</p>
<p>Roland perceived the effect of the music and was
satisfied. He had no fear of their future. What if
the gold was low in his purse? That charmful voice
was an unfailing bank from which to draw more.
He was so proud of his darling, so full of praises
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
and admiration, that Denas really put on an access
of genius as she robed herself to his flattering
words. Pleasure, and hope, and a pretty pride in
her husband&rsquo;s eulogies lent her new physical graces.
She was conscious that there were eyes at every
window watching Roland and herself leave the house,
and she felt certain that their owners were saying:
&ldquo;What a handsome couple! How fond they are of
each other! What a wonderful voice she has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is easy to be gay, and even beautiful, to such
thoughts; and Roland and Denas reached Signor
Maria&rsquo;s in a glow of good-humour and good hope.
The Signor was at home and ready to receive them.
He was a small, thin, dark man with long, curling
black hair and bright black eyes. He bowed to
Roland and looked with marked interest into the
fair, sparkling face of Denas. He was much pleased
with her appearance and quite interested in her
ambitions. Then he opened the piano and said,
&ldquo;Will monsieur play, or madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland played and Denas sang her very best.
The Signor listened attentively, and Roland was
sure of an enthusiastic verdict; on the contrary, it
was one of depressing qualifications. The Signor
acknowledged the quality of the voice, its charmful,
haunting tones&ndash;&ndash;but for the opera! oh, much more&ndash;&ndash;very,
very much more was needed. Madame must
go to Italy for three years and study. She must
learn the Italian language; the French; the German.
Ah! then there was the acting also! Had
madame histrionic power? That was indispensable
for the grand opera. But in three years&ndash;&ndash;perhaps
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
four&ndash;&ndash;with fine teachers her voice might be very
rich, very charming. <i>Now</i> it was harsh, crude,
unformed. Yes, it wanted the soft, mellowing airs
of Italy. Where had madame been living&ndash;&ndash;what
was called &ldquo;brought up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas answered she had always lived by the sea,
and the Signor nodded intelligently and said: &ldquo;Yes!
yes! that was what he heard in her voice; the fresh
wild winds&ndash;&ndash;yes, wild and salt! It is airs from the
rose gardens, velvety languors off the vineyards,
heat and passions of the sunshine madame wants.
Indeed, monsieur may take madame to Italy for two,
three, perhaps four years, and then expect her to
sing. Yes, then, even in grand opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was undoubtedly the Signor&rsquo;s honest opinion,
but Roland and Denas were greatly depressed by
it; Denas especially so, for she had an inward conviction
that he was right; she had heard the truth.
It was almost two different beings that left Signor
Maria&rsquo;s house. Silently Roland handed Denas into
the waiting cab, silently he seated himself beside
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I have disappointed you, Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little. But we are going now to Mr.
Harrison&rsquo;s. There is nothing foreign about him.
He is English, and he knows what English people
like. I shall wait for his verdict, Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a long ride to Mr. Harrison&rsquo;s, and Roland
did not speak until they were at his door. This
professor was a blond, effusive, large man of enthusiastic
temperament. He was delighted to listen to
Mrs. Tresham, and he saw possibilities for her that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Signor Maria never would have contemplated;
though when Roland told him what Maria had said
he endorsed his opinion so far as to admit the excellence
of such a training for a great prima donna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mrs. Tresham may learn just as well by experience
as by method,&rdquo; he averred. &ldquo;She sings
as the people enjoy singing. She sings their songs.
She has a powerful voice, which will grow stronger
with use. I think Mr. Willis will give her an
immediate engagement. Suppose we go and see.
Willis is at the hall, I should say, about this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a practical and flattering offer, and
Roland gladly accepted it. Willis Hall was soon
reached. It was used only for popular concerts and
very slight dramas in which there was a great deal
of singing and dancing. It had a well-appointed
stage and scenery, but the arrangement of the seats
showed a general democracy and a great freedom
of movement for the audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willis is always on the lookout for novelties,&rdquo;
said Professor Harrison, &ldquo;and I am sure these fishing
songs will &lsquo;fetch&rsquo; such an audience as he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was speaking Mr. Willis approached. He
listened to Professor Harrison&rsquo;s opinion and kept
his eyes on Denas while he did so. He thought her
appearance taking, and was pleased to give her
voice a trial. The hall was empty and very dull,
but a piano was pulled forward to the front of the
stage and Roland took his seat before it. Denas
was told to step to the front and sing to the two
gentlemen in the gallery. They applauded her first
song enthusiastically, and Denas sang each one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
better. But it was not their applause she listened
to&ndash;&ndash;it was the soft praises of Roland, his assurances
of her success, which stimulated her even beyond
her natural power.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the trial Mr. Willis offered
Denas twelve pounds a week, and if she proved a
favourite the sum was to be gradually increased.
The sum, though but a pittance of Roland&rsquo;s dreams,
was at least a livelihood and an earnest of advance,
and it was readily accepted. Then the little company
sat down upon the empty stage and discussed
the special songs and costumes in which Denas was
to make her d&eacute;but.</p>
<p>Never before in all his life had Roland found
business so interesting. He said to Denas, as they
talked over the affair at their own fireside, that he
thought he also had found his vocation. He felt at
home on the stage. He never had felt at home in
a bank or in a business office. He was determined
to study, and create a few great characters, and
become an actor. He felt the power; it was in
him, he said complacently. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;Denas, if you become a great singer and I a great
actor, we shall have the world at our feet. And I
like actors and those kind of people. I feel at
home with them. I like the life they lead&ndash;&ndash;the
jolly, come-day go-day, wandering kind of life. I
never was meant for a respectable man of business.
No: the stage! the stage! That is my real life.
I am certain of it. I wonder I never thought of it
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been arranged that Denas was to open
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
with Neil Gow&rsquo;s matchless song of &ldquo;<i>Caller Herrin&rsquo;!</i>&rdquo;
and her dress was of course that of an idealized
Newhaven fisher-girl. Her short, many-coloured
skirts, her trig latched shoon, her open throat, and
<a name='TC_6'></a><ins title="Was 'beatiful'">beautiful</ins> bare arms lifted to the basket upon her
head was a costume which suited her to admiration.
When she came stepping down the stage to the immortal
notes, and her voice thrilled the house with
the ringing musical &ldquo;cry&rdquo; that none hear and ever
forget:</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_1' id='linki_1'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/herrin.png' alt='' title="Cal-ler her-rin'! cal-ler her-rin'! cal-ler her-rin'!" width='500' height='77' /><br />
</div>
<p>the assembly broke into rapturous delight. It was
a song not above their comprehension and their
feeling. It was interpreted by one to whom the
interpretation was as natural as breathing. She
was recalled again, and again, and again, and the
uproar of approval only ceased when the next singer
advanced with a roll of music in his hand. He was
a pale, sentimental young man whose forte was
despairing love-songs, but</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last links are broken</p>

</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>had little interest after Mademoiselle Denasia&rsquo;s
unique melody. For it was by this name Denas had
consented to be known, the French prefix having but
a very indefinite significance to her mind. Roland
had told her that it meant a lady, and that all singers
were either mademoiselle or madame, and that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
was too young for madame, and the explanation had
been satisfactory.</p>
<p>Certainly, if signs could be trusted Mademoiselle
Denasia was likely to be a name in many mouths;
for her second and third songs were even more
startling in their success than &ldquo;Caller Herrin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
Mr. Willis would permit no further recalls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must give them Denasia in small doses,&rdquo;
he said, laughing; &ldquo;she is too precious to make common,&rdquo;
and Roland winced a moment at the familiar
tone in which his wife&rsquo;s name was spoken. But
both alike were under a spell. The intoxicating cup
of public applause was at their lips. Their brains
were full of the wildest dreams, their hearts full of
the wildest hopes. No consideration at that time
could have turned their feet aside from the flower-covered,
treacherous path they were so gayly
treading.</p>
<p>Such a life would have simply been beyond the
power of John and Joan Penelles to imagine. Its
riot of dress and emotions and its sinful extravagance
in every direction would have been to them
an astounding revelation of the possibilities of life.
As it was, their anxiety took mainly one direction:
the uncertainty attending the marriage of their
daughter. Denas had indeed said she was Roland&rsquo;s
wife, but the St. Penfer <i>News</i> implied a very different
relationship; and John had all that superstitious
belief in a newspaper which is so often an attribute
of ignorance.</p>
<p>At any rate, the want of authentic data about the
marriage humiliated and made him miserable. Two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
more weeks had passed since that eventful Sunday
night service at St. Clair, and yet John had no assurance
of a more certain character to rely on. Three
or four illustrated papers had been received with
&ldquo;love from your daughter, Denas Tresham,&rdquo; written
on the title-page; but the claim thus made satisfied
no one but Joan. Joan believed in the validity of
the name, and handed around the sheets with a confidence
few cared to in any degree dispute.</p>
<p>The third Sunday was an important one to the
fisher-folk. There was to be a missionary sermon
preached in the St. Clair chapel, and John and Joan
went there. The chapel was crowded. Joan got a
seat, but John lingered in the small vestibule within
the door among the few brethren waiting for the
strange preacher. It was the same person who had
married Roland and Denas, and after he had shaken
himself free from his dripping cloak he looked at
the men around him, and his eyes fell upon John.
And probably all the circumstances of that marriage
were either well known or accurately divined, for he
took the big fisherman by the hand and said cheerfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Penelles, I am glad, very glad indeed to
meet you. I suppose you know that it was I who
married your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a fixed star had fallen at John&rsquo;s feet he could
not have been more amazed. His large face lightened
from within, he clasped firmly the preacher&rsquo;s
hand, but was so slow in forcing speech from his
swelling heart that the preacher continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they came to me, and I remembered your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
pretty child. I tied them true and fast, you may be
sure of that, John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Plymouth Wesleyan chapel, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! Thank you too, sir! You might
say so&ndash;&ndash;some people here be slow to believe, sir,
and it be breaking my heart, it be indeed, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was only a nod and smile in reply, but John
was extremely happy. He tried to get near to Joan
and tell her; but the aisles were full and the service
was beginning. John held his own service,
and the singing, and the prayer, and preaching were
just a joyful accompaniment to the thanksgiving in
his heart. At length the service was over, and the
preacher lifted a number of slips of paper and
began to read aloud the announcements made on
them. Missionary meetings, tea meetings for missions,
a bazaar at St. Penfer for missions, a Bible
meeting, a class meeting, and the service for that
evening. Then, while the congregation were still
expectant, he said in a clear, pleasant voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am requested also to say that on December
the 17th, on Tuesday morning at nine o&rsquo;clock, I
united in the holy bands of marriage Denasia, the
daughter of John Penelles, fisher of St. Penfer, to
Roland Tresham, gentleman of that place. The
ceremony was performed by me in the Wesleyan
chapel at Plymouth; myself, my wife, and two
daughters being witnesses to it. We will now sing
the 444th hymn:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lord over all, if Thou hast made,</p>
<p>Hast ransomed every soul of man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></div>
<p>And all the congregation rose, and in the rising the
conscious glance that passed through the chapel
was lost in a more general purpose. It was presumed,
at least, that everyone was singing a prayer
for the heathen. Only Joan Penelles made no effort
to think of India or Africa. Her face, full of
radiant assurance, looked confidently over the crowd,
seeking her husband&rsquo;s mutual glance of pleasure.
Her faith had been justified. Her girl was an honourable
wife&ndash;&ndash;the wife of a gentleman well known
to all. She had no longer any need to hide the
wounding look or doubtful word in a protesting attitude,
as painful to her as it was offensive to others.</p>
<p>Well, it is a very hard thing to rejoice with those
that do rejoice; evidently in that little chapel it
was easier for the worshippers to be sorry for the
heathen than to be glad for their brother and sister
Penelles. Never had John and Joan felt themselves
so far away from the sympathy of their fellows.
Only a few rough men who handled the nets with
John, and who knew how hard the duty had been to
him since his little girl went away, said a word of
congratulation. But one and another of these, as
they passed John and Joan on their way home, said
a hearty &ldquo;Praise God, brother John,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;God
bless you both, &rsquo;twas good news for you this morning.&rdquo;
But, with or without sympathy, the happy
father and mother walked to their house that day
up-head and bravely. Their hearts had been miraculously
lightened, and it was not until the burden
had rolled away that they knew how woefully heavy
it had been.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></div>
<p>The next afternoon, when the wind was blowing
inland too fiercely to permit boats to leave the harbour,
a man who had been up the cliff brought back
with him a letter for the Penelles. It was evidently
from Denas. John looked at the postmark, &ldquo;London,&rdquo;
and turned it around and around till Joan was
nervous. &ldquo;Aw, then, John, do open it, and read
what be inside&ndash;&ndash;do, my dear!&rdquo; And John read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Father and Mother</span>:&ndash;&ndash;I have been intending
to write to you every day, but I have been
so happy that the days went away like a dream. I
wish you knew my dear Roland as I do. He is the
kindest of men, the most generous, the dearest in
the whole world. He does nothing but try how to
give me pleasure. He has bought me such lovely
dresses, and rings, and bracelets, and he takes me
everywhere. I never, never did think life could be
so happy. I am going to have lessons too. I am
to be taught how to sing and to do other things
right, and your little Denas is the very happiest
girl in the world. London is such a grand place,
the very streets are all shows. Your loving daughter,</p>
<p class='closing sig2'>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Denas Tresham.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;P. S.&ndash;&ndash;Perhaps you may wonder where we were
married. It was at Plymouth, by the Wesleyan
preacher. Father knows him, I think. D.&nbsp;T.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A dead silence followed the reading of the letter.
Joan sat upright with a troubled face. She had
been washing the dinner dishes; the towel lay
across her lap, and her fingers pleated and unpleated
the bit of coarse linen. John laid his arms across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
his knees and dropped a stern face toward them.
The bit of white paper was in his big brown fingers.
He did not speak a word; his heart was full, his
eyes were full, his tongue was heavy and dumb.
Joan grew restless and hot with anger, for she was
wounded in every sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, my dear, she be so happy with that man
she do forget the days she was happy with you and
me, John. She do forget all and everything. Aw,
then, &rsquo;tis a cruel, thoughtless letter. Cruel beyond
words to tell&ndash;&ndash;dreadful! aw, dreadful! God help
us! And I do wish I could forget her! And I do
be sorry she was ever born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whist! whist! my old dear. She has gone into
the wilderness. Our one little ewe lamb has gone
into the wilderness, and aw, my dear, &rsquo;twill keep
us busy all night and day to send love and prayer
enough after her. There be wolves there, Joan;
wolves, my dear, ready to devour&ndash;&ndash;and the man she
loves, he be one of them. Poor little Denas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan went on with her housework, but John
sat silent, bending down toward the letter. And
by and by his white face glowed with a dull red
colour, and he tore the letter up, tore it very slowly
into narrow ribbon-like strips, and let them fall,
one by one, at his feet. He was in a mood Joan did
not care to trouble. It reminded her of the day
when he had felled Jacob Trenager. She was glad
to see him rise and go to the inner room, glad to
hear that he bolted the door after him. For in
that temper it was better that John should complain
to God than talk with any human being.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Denasia</span> made her <i>d&eacute;but</i> in the last ten days
of January, and she retained the favour of
that public which frequented Willis Hall for three
months. Then her reputation was a little worn;
people whistled and sang her songs and were
pleased with their own performance of them. And
Roland, also, had tired a little of the life&ndash;&ndash;of its
regularity and its obligations. He was now often
willing to let any other performer who desired to
do so take his place at the piano. He began to
have occasional lookings-backward to Burrell Court
and the respectability it represented.</p>
<p>Then at the close of April Denasia fell ill. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
poor girl fretted at the decline of enthusiasm in her
audience. She made stupendous efforts to regain
her place in the popular favour, and she failed because
of the natural law which few are strong enough
to defy&ndash;&ndash;that change is as necessary to amusement
as fidelity is to duty. Denasia did not indeed reason
about the event; the simple fact that she had no
recalls and no clamorous approval made her miserable,
and then sickness followed.</p>
<p>She was very ill indeed, and for four weeks confined
to her room; and when she was able to consider
a return to the hall, Roland found that her
place had been taken by a Spanish singer with a
mandolin and a wonderful dance. That was really
a serious disappointment to the young couple, for
during the month money had been going out and
none coming in. For even when Denasia had
been making twenty-five pounds a week, they had
lived and dressed up to the last shilling; so that a
month&rsquo;s enforced idleness and illness placed them
deeply in debt and uncomfortably pressed for the
wherewithal to meet debt.</p>
<p>Denasia also had been much weakened by her illness.
Her fine form and colour were impaired, she
was nervous and despondent; and a suffering, sickly
wife was quite out of Roland&rsquo;s calculations and
very much out of his sympathies. Poverty had a bad
effect upon him. To be without money to buy the
finest brand of cigars, to be annoyed by boarding-house
keepers, tailors, and costumers, to have to
buy medicines with cash when he was without his
usual luxuries, was a condition of affairs that struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
Roland as extremely improper for a young man of
his family and education.</p>
<p>And he disliked now to interview managers. Mademoiselle
Denasia was a recognised member of the
profession which more than any other demands that
everyone stand upon their merits; and Denasia had
not been a very pronounced success. She remained
just about where she had begun, and managers naturally
thought that she had done the best of which
she was capable. That best was not a phenomenal
one, and Roland, as her husband and business
agent, received no extraordinary amount of respect.
He was offended where he had no reason for offence&ndash;&ndash;offended
often because everyone did not recognise
him as a member of an old Cornish family
and the son of an ex-lord mayor of London. Often
he felt obliged, in order to satisfy his own self-respect,
to make the fact known; and the chaff, or
indifference, or incredulity, with which his claims
were received made him change his opinions regarding
the &ldquo;jolly company of actors.&rdquo; In fact, he
was undoubtedly at this period of Denasia&rsquo;s career
her very worst enemy; for whatever Denasia might
be, Roland and his pretensions were usually regarded
as a great bore.</p>
<p>One afternoon in May he became thoroughly disgusted
with the life he had chosen for himself. The
bright sunshine made the shabby carpet and tawdry
furniture and soiled mirrors intolerably vulgar.
They had just finished a badly cooked, crossly
served, untidy dinner, and Roland had no cigar to
mend it. Denasia had not eaten at all; she lay on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
the bright blue sofa with shut eyes, and her faded
beauty and faded dress were offensive to the fastidious
young man.</p>
<p>She was thinking of her father&rsquo;s cottage, of
the love at its hearth, and of the fresh salt winds
blowing all around it. Roland half-divined her
thoughts, and his own wandered to Burrell Court
and his long-neglected sister.</p>
<p>Suddenly he resolved to go and see her. Elizabeth
had always plenty of money, then why should
he be without it? And the desire having entered
his heart, he was as imperative as a spoiled child for
its gratification. Denasia&rsquo;s physical condition did
not appeal to him in any degree; he could not help
her weakness and suffering, and certainly it was
very inconvenient for him. He felt at that hour as
if Denasia had broken her part of their mutual compact,
which had not included illness or loss of
prestige and beauty. He turned sharply to her and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denasia, I am going to St. Penfer. I shall have
to sell a ring or something valuable in order to get
the fare, but I see no other way. Elizabeth never
disappointed my expectations; she will give me
money, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me, Roland. I will get well, I
will indeed, dear. I am better this afternoon. In
a few days&ndash;&ndash;in a week, Roland, I can find some
place to sing. Please have a little patience. Oh,
do, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little patience! What are you saying, Denasia?
You are very ungrateful! Have I not had patience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
for a whole month? Have I not spent even my
cigar-money for you? Patience, indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there nowhere but St. Penfer? No person
but Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go to St. Merryn&rsquo;s, if you like. Give me
an order for the money in your name at St. Merryn&rsquo;s
Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned sullen in a moment. &ldquo;I have told
you a thousand times, Roland, I would rather die
of hunger than rob my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, why do you complain if I go to
my own people? I hope when I return you will be
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland! Roland! You are surely not going
to leave me&ndash;&ndash;in a moment&ndash;&ndash;without anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cry so full of anguish brought him back to
her side; but his purpose had taken full possession
of him; only he left her with those kisses and
promises which women somehow manage to live
upon. He still loved her in his way of loving, but
his way demanded so many pleasant accidentals
that it was impossible for Denasia always to provide
them. And yet, having once realised, in a great
measure, his ideal of her value to his happiness, he
did feel that her sudden break-down in health was a
failure he ought to show disapproval of.</p>
<p>However, there was method even in Roland&rsquo;s
selfish plans. He did not wish to find Mr. Burrell
at St. Penfer, so he went to the bank and ascertained
his whereabouts. He was told that Mr.
Burrell had just left for Berlin, and was likely to
be a week or ten days away. This information quite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
elated Roland. He sold his watch and took the
first train to Cornwall. And as he was certain that
Elizabeth would have settled his bill at the Black
Lion, he went there with all his old swaggering
good-humour and thoroughly refreshed himself before
going out to Burrell Court.</p>
<p>Elizabeth gave him a hearty welcome; she was
indeed particularly glad to see him just then. She
was lonely in the absence of her husband; she had
just had a slight disagreement with the ladies at a
church meeting; she was feeling her isolation and
her want of family support; and she had met, for
the first time since their interview, the Rev. Mr.
Farrar, who had presumed to arrest her coachman
and, in the presence of her servants, congratulate
her on the marriage of her brother and her friend.
Under the circumstances, she had judged it best to
make no remarks; but she was very angry, and not
sorry to have the culprit in her presence and tell
him exactly what she thought of his folly and disgrace.</p>
<p>She kept the lecture, however, until they had
dined and were alone; then, as he sat serenely smoking
one of Mr. Burrell&rsquo;s finest cigars, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are come back to me, Roland. I
hope you have left that woman for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who do you mean by &lsquo;that woman,&rsquo; Elizabeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;De&ndash;&ndash;You know who I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas! Left Denas! Left my wife! That is absurd,
Elizabeth! I wanted to see you. I could not
bear to be &lsquo;out&rsquo; with you any longer. You know,
dear, that you are my only blood relative. Denas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
is my relative by marriage. Blood is thicker than&ndash;&ndash;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland, you know how I love you. You are
the first person I remember. All my life long you
have been first in my heart. How do you think I
liked to be put aside for&ndash;&ndash;that fisher-girl? It
nearly broke my heart with shame and sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have told you, Elizabeth. I did
behave badly to you. I am ashamed of myself.
Forgive me, darling sister.&rdquo; And he pulled his chair
to her side, and put his arm around her neck, and
kissed her with no simulated affection. For he
would indeed have been heartless had he been insensible
to the true love which softened every tone
in Elizabeth&rsquo;s voice and made her handsome face
shine with tender interest and unselfish solicitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have told you, Elizabeth. I believe
you are noble enough to have accepted Denas for
my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not, Roland. Nothing could have made
me accept her. I have taken a personal dislike to
her. I am sure that I cannot even do her justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been very ill. She is still very weak.
I have been unable to get her all the comforts she
ought to have had&ndash;&ndash;unable to take her to the sea-side,
though the doctor told me it was an imperative
necessity. We have been very poor, but not
unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understood she was making a great deal of
money with her trashy, vulgar little songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was until she fell ill. And whatever her
songs are, they have been very much admired.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;By her own class. And you let her sing for
your living! I am amazed at you, Roland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see why. You wanted me to marry
Caroline Burrell and let her support me out of the
money old Burrell worked for. Denas loves me,
and the money she gives me is given with love.
Old Burrell never saw me, and if he had I am quite
sure he would have hated me and despised me as a
fortune-hunter. Denas is a noble little darling.
She has never inferred, either by word or look, that
she sang for my living. It took you to do that,
Elizabeth. Besides, I help Denas to make money.
I arrange her business and I play her accompaniments,
and, as I said, I love her and she loves me.
Why, I have done without cigars to buy medicines
for her; and if that isn&rsquo;t a proof of my devotion,
I do not know how to give one! I can tell you
that Mademoiselle Denasia is a great favourite with
everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Denasia!&rdquo; cried Elizabeth with
the utmost scorn. &ldquo;Mademoiselle! and Denasia!
However, she might well change her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not change her name. She was baptised
Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Robert went to hear her sing. He says it was
in a fourth-rate place, and I can tell you he was
burning with indignation to see his brother-in-law
playing a piano there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he ought to let his anger burn to some
purpose. Signor Maria says that if Denasia had
proper masters and was sent to Italy for two or
three years she could sing in grand opera. Mind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
Maria says that; not I. Suppose you get Robert to
send Denas to Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do nothing at all for Denas. And I think,
Roland, that you ought to do something for yourself.
I hate to think of my own brother taking his
living from that fisherman&rsquo;s daughter. It is a
shame! Father brought you up like a gentleman,
sent you to college, gave you an opportunity&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If father had given me a profession of any kind,
if he had put me in the army or the navy, I should
be to blame. If he had bought me a kit of carpenters&rsquo;
tools and had me taught how to use them,
I should be no man at all if I looked to a woman
for a living. But he did not. He sent me to college,
gave me expensive tastes, and then got me a
desk in a bank, where the only prospect before me
was to add figures for the rest of my life for two
pounds a week. Naturally I looked around for
something more to my liking. I found Denasia. I
loved her. She loved me. I could play, she could
sing, and we made twenty-five pounds a week.
That is the true state of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you intend to spend your life playing
accompaniments to fishing-songs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I am studying for the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland Tresham! Roland Tresham!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I have a new conception of the character
of Orlando and I flatter myself the Romeo is yet
to be played. I shall attempt it next winter.
Now, Elizabeth, all the summer is before us. If
you will not ask us to Burrell Court, then do in
sisterly kindness send us to some quiet sea-side
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
place to study. We could, of course, come to Penelles&rsquo;
cottage&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you could not. John Penelles would not
permit you to enter his door. He says he will
never forgive his daughter until she leaves you for
ever. I understand him. I cannot fully forgive
you while you remain with that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you John Penelles said such a thing?
I do not believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla Mohun. He said it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! He would not say it to Denasia. And it
would not be a bad place to study. I should soon
be a favourite with the fishers. I know how to get
around that class of people, and I am fond of the
sea and could spend a month very comfortably
there. Cigars make any place comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are talking simple nonsense, Roland. You
know it, too. Penelles would not endure your presence
five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done his daughter no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He believes that you have ruined her immortal
soul. You are the devil incarnate to John Penelles.
He would not let you put your foot in his cottage.
And he is not a man to trifle with. He knocked
Jacob Trenager down, and the man goes lame ever
since, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going in his way to be knocked down.
It is absolutely necessary, both for Denas and myself,
to be near London. If we had the means I
would go to Broadstairs or perhaps Hastings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to ask me for money, Roland? If
so, be man enough to ask me plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want money, Elizabeth. I want you to
give it to me. I have not troubled you for a long
time, have I? All my life long I have come to
you for money, and you never yet refused me.
My dear sister, I remember that you once sold a
brooch for me when we were both children.&rdquo; He
kissed her and was silent, and Elizabeth&rsquo;s face was
wet with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could give the last shilling I had to you, Roland,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;but it is hard to ask me to rob
myself for that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is my wife. I want her to get strong and
well. She is a comfort and a pleasure to me. You
were always glad to give me money for my comforts
and pleasures. You never before asked me what
they were or said: &lsquo;You cannot have money for
such or such a purpose.&rsquo; You gave me money for
whatever I wanted. Now I want Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Denasia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Denasia. I want Denasia as I want
my cigars or any other pleasant thing in life. Does
it matter to you, if the money makes me happy, how
I spend it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you put the question in that light I do not
suppose it does matter.&rdquo; Then after a moment&rsquo;s
pause: &ldquo;Every shilling will be a coal of fire upon
Mademoiselle Denasia&rsquo;s head. There is nothing
wrong in that consideration&ndash;&ndash;it is perfectly Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was perfectly unchristian; but,
then, I am only a sinner. However, Elizabeth, if
you can help me to get Denasia to the sea-side the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
action will be a good one, and we need not go
about to question the motives for it. I think one
hundred pounds will keep us until Denasia is able
to sing again or I get an engagement as Romeo.
I shall make up splendidly as Romeo. You must
come and see me, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for anything in life! And one hundred
pounds is a large sum of money. I cannot afford it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Elizabeth, I must have one hundred. I
need every penny of it. I cannot do with less.
Give me one hundred, Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it will trouble me very much to spare
a hundred pounds. It will indeed, Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Roland stuck to the idea of one hundred
pounds, and finally Elizabeth gave way before his
entreaties. She looked at the handsome fellow and
sighed hopelessly. She said, &ldquo;I will give it to you,
and do as you wish with it.&rdquo; Why should she now
look for consideration from her brother? He had
never yet reached higher ground than &ldquo;I want;&rdquo;
and to expect Roland to look beyond himself was
to expect the great miracle that never comes.</p>
<p>He remained with his sister ten days, and thoroughly
enjoyed the change of life. And indeed he
found himself quite a little hero in St. Penfer.
Miss Mohun met him with smiles; she asked sweetly
after Mrs. Tresham and never once named the fifty
pounds Roland had promised her. The landlady
of the Black Lion made a great deal of him.
She came herself of fisher-folk, and she was pleased
that the young gentleman had treated her caste
honourably. The landlord gave him cigars and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
wine, and all the old companions of his pleasures
and necessities showed him that they approved his
conduct. The Rev. Mr. Farrar made a point of
praising him. As he stood with the landlord of the
Black Lion at the open door of the inn, he said to
him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tresham, I respect your strength of character.
I know that in certain circles of society it
is considered a slight offence for a young man to
seduce a girl of the lower orders; but that a <i>mesalliance</i>
with her is a social crime almost unpardonable.
You have said boldly to the whole community
that it is more ungentlemanly to wrong a poor girl&rsquo;s
honour than to marry a wife below your own station.
Sir, such an example is worth all the sermons
that could be preached on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Roland listened to all the spoken and unspoken
praise given him with a smiling appropriation.
It really never struck him, or apparently
anyone else, that Denas might have been the
person who took care of her own honour; or that
Roland had done right because he could not induce
his companion to do wrong. And there was another
popular view of this marriage which was singularly
false&ndash;&ndash;the general assumption that Denas
had been greatly honoured by it, and that John and
Joan Penelles ought to be pleased and satisfied.
Why not? Such a decision was the evident one,
and how many people have the time or the interest
in any subject to go below or beyond the evident?</p>
<p>One morning when Roland had been put into a
very good humour by the public approval of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
conduct, he saw John Penelles and Tris Penrose
and two other fishers go into the Ship Inn together.
They had Lawyer Tremaine with them, and were
doubtless met to complete the sale or purchase of
some fishing-craft. Roland knew that it would be
an affair to occupy two or three hours, and he
suddenly resolved to go down the cliff and interview
his mother-in-law. It would please Denasia,
and he was himself in that reckless mood of self-complacency
which delights in testing its influence.</p>
<p>Without further consideration he lit a fresh cigar
and went down the familiar path. It was full of
memories of his wooing of Denas, and he smiled
with a soft triumph to them. And the exquisite
morning, the thrushes singing to the sun, the fluting
of the blackbirds, the south wind swinging the blue-bells,
the mystical murmur of the sea&ndash;&ndash;all these
things set themselves unconsciously to his overweening
self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>The door of the Penelles cottage was wide open,
and he stood a moment looking into it. The place
had an Homeric simplicity and beauty which
touched his sense of fitness. On the snow-white
hearth there was a handful of red fire, and the
bright black hob held the shining kettle. A rug
of knitted bits of many-coloured cloths was before
it, and on this rug stood John&rsquo;s big cushioned
chair. The floor was white as pipeclay could
make it; the walls covered with racks of showy
crockery; the spotless windows quite shaded with
blossoming flowers; and the deal furniture had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
scrubbed with oatmeal until it had the colour and
the beauty of ivory.</p>
<p>Joan sat with her back to the door. She was
perfectly still. At her feet there was a pile of nets,
and she was mending the broken meshes. When
Roland tapped she let them fall and stood upright.
She knew him at once. Her fine rosy face turned
grey as ashes. She folded her arms across her
breast and stood looking at the intruder. For a
moment they remained thus&ndash;&ndash;the gay, handsome,
fashionably-dressed young man smiling at the tall
grave woman in her neat print gown and white
linen cap. Roland broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Roland Tresham,&rdquo; he said pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do know you. What be you come for? Is
Denas&ndash;&ndash;where be my child? Oh, man, why don&rsquo;t
you say the words, whatever they be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry if I frightened you. I thought you
might like to know that Denas was well and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan went back to her nets and sat down
without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in St. Penfer on business, and I thought
you would like to know&ndash;&ndash;might like to know&ndash;&ndash;you
see, I was here on business&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was growing every moment more uncomfortable
and embarrassed, for Joan bent busily over
her work and her back was to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I was here on business. I wanted to
see my sister. I thought you would like to know
about Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned suddenly on him and asked: &ldquo;Where
be my child?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I left Denas in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be a coward. You be a tenfold coward.
Why didn&rsquo; you bring your wife home with you?
Did Denas send me no letter&ndash;&ndash;no word for myself&ndash;&ndash;for
my heart only? Speak then; I want my letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left in a hurry. She had no time to write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, why did you come here without a
word of comfort? You be cruel as well as cowardly.
No word! No letter! No time! There
then! take yourself away from my door. &rsquo;Twas a
wisht cruel thought brought you here. Aw, then,
a thought out of your own heart. You be a bad
man! dreadful! dreadful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my good woman, I wish to be kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good woman! Sure enough! but I have my
husband&rsquo;s name, thank God, and there then! when
you speak to me I be called by it&ndash;&ndash;Joan Penelles.
And Joan Penelles do wish you would turn your
back on this house; she do that, for you do have a
sight of ghastly mean old ways&ndash;&ndash;more than either
big or little devil means a young man to have.
There then! Go afore John Penelles do find you
here. For &rsquo;twill be a bad hour for you if he do&ndash;&ndash;and
so it will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not expect such a reception, Mrs. Penelles.
I have dealt honourably with your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have made my daughter to sin. Aw, then,
I will not talk about my daughter with you. No
indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no message to send to Denas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas do know her mother&rsquo;s heart and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
father&rsquo;s heart, and when she do find it in her own
heart to leave that sinful place&ndash;&ndash;the the-a-tre&ndash;&ndash;and
dress herself like a decent wife and a good woman,
and sing for God and not for the devil, and sing
for love and not for money, aw, then, who will love
her as quick and as warm as I will? But if you do
want a message, tell her she have broken her good
father&rsquo;s life in two; and that I do blame myself I
ever gave her suck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland listened to these words with a scoffing
air of great amusement; he looked steadily at Joan
with a smile that was intolerable to her, then he
raised his hat with an elaborate flourish and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Penelles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No notice was taken of this salute, and he added
with an offensive mirthfulness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to say, &lsquo;Good-morning,
mother.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan leaped to her feet as if she had been
struck in the face. She kicked the nets from her
and strode to the open door in a flaming passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;not your mother, thank
God! Not your mother, or you&rsquo;d be in the boats
making your awn living. You! you cruel, cowardly,
lazy, lounging, bad lot! Living on my poor
little girl, you be! You vampire! Living on her
body and soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, where is Mr. Penelles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, to be sure. Well you knew he wasn&rsquo; here,
or you would never have put foot this road. And
no madam I be, but honest Joan Penelles. Go!
The Pender men are near by. Go!&ndash;&ndash;and the Trefy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
men, and Jack Penhelick, and Reuben Trewillow.
Go!&ndash;&ndash;they are close by, I tell you. Go!&ndash;&ndash;if I
call they&rsquo;ll come. Go!&ndash;&ndash;or they will know the
reason why!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, still smiling and knocking the end of his
cigar against the end of his cane, Roland leisurely
took the road to the cliff. But Joan, in her passionate
sense of intolerable wrong, flung up her arms toward
heaven, and with tears and sobs her cry went
up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my God! Look down and see what sin this
Roland Tresham be doing!&rdquo;</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Ten</span> days of the methodical serenity of Burrell
Court wearied Roland, and with money in his
pocket the thought of London was again a temptation.
He was quickly satisfied with green gardens
and sea-breezes; the pavements of Piccadilly and Regent
Street were more attractive. And for Roland,
the last wish or the last plan held the quality of
fascination. When he turned his back upon Burrell
Court, Elizabeth faded from his thoughts and
affections; it was Denasia who then drew him
through every side of his vivid imagination and
reckless desires.</p>
<p>He had written to her as soon as Elizabeth promised
him the money he needed; for he believed when
Denasia was free from care she would speedily
recover her health and strength. He pleased himself
all the way home with the anticipation of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
wife&rsquo;s smiles and welcome, and he was a little
frightened not to see her face at the window the
moment his cab arrived. He expected her to be
watching; he was sure, if she were able, she would
not have disappointed him. He had a latch-key in
his pocket, and he opened the door and went rapidly
to the room they occupied. It was empty; it was
cleaned and renovated and evidently waiting for
a new tenant.</p>
<p>Full of trouble and amazement, he was going to
seek his landlady, when she appeared. She was as
severely polite as people who have got the last
penny they hope to get out of one can be. Mrs.
Tresham had gone to the sea-side. She had left
five days ago&ndash;&ndash;gone to Broadstairs. The address
was in the letter which she gave him. Greatly to
Roland&rsquo;s relief she said nothing about money, and
he certainly had no wish to introduce the subject.</p>
<p>But he was amazed beyond measure. Where had
Denasia got money? How had she got it? Why
had she said nothing to him? He had had a letter
two days before, and he took it out of his pocket and
re-read it. There was no allusion to the change,
but he saw that the postmark showed it to have
been mailed on the way to the Chatham and Dover
Railway. However, he was not anxious enough to
pursue his journey that night. He went to a hotel,
had a good dinner, slept off his fatigue, and started
for Broadstairs at a comfortable hour in the morning.</p>
<p>Nothing like jealousy troubled him. He had no
more fear of Denasia&rsquo;s honour and loyalty than he
had of the sun rising; and with a hundred pounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
in his pocket curiosity was a feeble feeling. &ldquo;Some
way all is right, and when a thing is right there is
no need to worry about it.&rdquo; This was his ultimate
reflection, and he slept comfortably upon it.</p>
<p>Broadstairs was a new place, and to Roland novelty
of any kind had a charm. A fine morning, a good
cigar, a change of scene, and Denasia at the end,
what more was necessary to a pleasant trip? His
first disillusion was the house to which he was
directed. It was but a cottage, and in some peculiar
way Roland had persuaded himself that Denasia
had not only got money, but also a large sum. The
cottage in which he found her did not confirm his
anticipations. And in the small parlour Denasia
was taking a dancing-lesson. An elderly lady was
playing the violin and directing her steps. Of
course the lesson ceased at Roland&rsquo;s entrance; there
was so much else to be talked over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you come to this out-of-the-way place?&rdquo;
asked Roland with a slight tone of disapprobation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because both my singing and dancing teachers
were here for the summer months, and I longed for
the salt air. I felt that it was the only medicine
that would restore me. You see I am nearly well
already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the money, Denasia? And do you know
that old harpy in London never named money. Is
she paid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you say harpy? She only wanted what
we really owed her. And she was good and patient
when I was ill. Yes, I paid her nine pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one hundred pounds, Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote and told me so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth gave it to me; and I must say she
gave it very kindly and pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Elizabeth gave you it. Why not? Is
there any merit in her doing a kindness to her own
brother pleasantly? How else should she do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was given as much for you as for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly not. If Elizabeth has the most ordinary
amount of sense, she knows well I would not
touch a farthing of her money; no, I would not if
I was dying of hunger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is absurd, Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it what you will. I hate Elizabeth and
Elizabeth hates me, and I will not touch her money
or anything that is bought with it. For you it is
different. Elizabeth loves you. She is rich, and if
she desires to give you money I see no reason why
you should refuse it&ndash;&ndash;that is, if you see none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray what are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I suffered in your absence? You left me
sick, nervous, without a shilling. I have made for
myself a good engagement and received fifty pounds
in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good engagement! Where? With whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am learning to sing a part in &lsquo;Pinafore.&rsquo; I
am engaged at the Olympic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denasia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flushed proudly at his amazement, and when he
took her in his arms and kissed her, she permitted
him to see that her eyes were full of happy tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she resumed in softer tones, &ldquo;I went to
see Colonel Moss, and he was delighted with my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
voice. Mr. Harrison says I learn with extraordinary
rapidity and have quite wonderful dramatic talent,
and madame has almost as much praise for my
dancing. I had to pay some bills out of the fifty
pounds; but I am sure I can live upon the balance
and pay for my lessons until September. As soon
as I am strong enough to look after my costumes,
my manager will advance money for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you are to have fifty pounds
a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to have thirty pounds a week. That is
very good pay, indeed, for a novice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For six nights and a matin&eacute;e? You ought to
have had far more; it is not five pounds a performance.
You ought to have ten pounds. I must see
about this arrangement. Moss has taken advantage
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given my promise, Roland, and I intend
to keep it. You must not interfere in this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be useless. I shall stand to my own
arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very poor one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is better than any you ever made for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course! I had all the preparatory work to do,
getting you known&ndash;&ndash;getting a hearing for you, in
fact. Now the harvest is ripe, it is easy enough
to get offers. You had better let me have a talk
with Moss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have signed all the necessary papers. I have
accepted fifty pounds in advance. I will not&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;I
will not break a letter of my promise for anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall have nothing to do with the affair.
It is a swindle on Moss&rsquo; part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not. He made me a fair offer; I, of my
own free will and judgment, accepted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty pounds a week! What is that for a first-class
part?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good salary. I can pay my expenses
and buy my wardrobe out of it. You have Elizabeth&rsquo;s
money. When it is done she will probably
give you more. She ought to, as you preferred
trusting to her.&rdquo; But though the words were laughingly
said, they sprang from a root of bitterness.</p>
<p>In fact, Roland quickly discovered that those ten
days he had so idly passed at Burrell Court with
his sister had been ten days of amazing growth in
every direction to Denasia. She had wept when Roland
so suddenly left her; wept at his want of faith
in her, at his want of care for her, at his indifference
to her weakness and poverty. But to sit still
and cry was not the way of her class. She had been
accustomed to reflect, when trouble came, whether
it could be helped or could not be helped. If the
former, then it was &ldquo;up and about it;&rdquo; if the latter,
tears were useless, and to make the best of the irrevocable
was the way of wisdom.</p>
<p>In an hour she had conquered the physical weakness
which spoke by weeping. A suspicion of
cruelty gave her the salutary stimulus of a lash;
she sat upright and began to plan. The next day
she went out, sold a bracelet, hired a cab, and went
from one manager to another until she succeeded.
Brought face to face with the question of work and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
wage, all the shrewd calculating instincts of a race
of women accustomed to chaffer and bargain awoke
within her. She sold her wares to good advantage,
and she knew she had done so. Then a long-nascent
distrust of Roland&rsquo;s business tact and ability sprang
suddenly to vigorous life. She realised in a moment
all the financial mistakes of the past winter.
She resolved not to have them repeated.</p>
<p>The sea air soon restored all her vigour and her
beauty. She gave herself to study and to practice
with an industry often irritating to Roland. It
reproached his own idleness and it deprived him
of her company. He did indeed rehearse his characters,
and in a stealthy way he endeavoured to find
a better engagement for Denasia. He was sure
that if he were successful there would be no difficulty
in inducing, or if necessary compelling, his
wife to accept it. He could as easily have made
Queen Victoria accept it. For with the inherited
shrewdness of her class she had also their integrity.
She would have kept any engagement she made even
if it had ruined her.</p>
<p>The winter was a profitable one, though not as
happy as Denasia had hoped it would be. They
had no debts and were able to indulge in many
luxuries, and yet Roland was irritable, gloomy, and
full of unpleasant reminiscences and comparisons.
He thought it outrageous for Moss to refuse the
payment of his wife&rsquo;s salary to him. And Denasia
had a disagreeable habit of leaving a large portion
of her income with the treasurer of the company,
and then sending her costumer and other creditors
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
to the theatre for payment. Indeed, she was developing
an independence in money matters that was extremely
annoying to Roland. He felt that his
applications to Elizabeth were perpetual offences to
Denasia, and if he had been a thoughtful man he
would have understood that this separation of their
interests in financial matters was the precursor of a
much wider and more dangerous one.</p>
<p>Roland had other unpleasant experiences to encounter.
It seemed incredible that the handsome,
witty, fascinating Mr. Tresham could possibly be
a bore, and yet the authorities in various green-rooms
either said so in plain English or made him
aware of the fact through every other sense but
hearing. He felt himself to be politely or sarcastically
quizzed. Stars ignored him; meaner lights
gave him a bare tolerance. A few inquired if his
grand relatives had yet forgiven him. One or two
affected to have heard he had an offer from Henry
Irving, or some other histrionic luminary; in fact,
he gradually was made to understand that Roland
Tresham was by no means a name to conjure with.</p>
<p>He did not tell Denasia of these humiliations,
and she believed that his chagrin and ill-temper
arose from his continual disappointments. He could
get no chance worthy of his efforts for a trial of
his new Shakespearian interpretations. He felt sure
there was a coalition against him. &ldquo;Let a man
have a little more beauty or talent than the crowd,
and the crowd are determined to ruin him, naturally,&rdquo;
he said, and he believed his own dictum thoroughly.
Toward the end of the season, however, he did obtain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
a hearing under what were undoubtedly favourable
circumstances; and then the press was his enemy.
And he knew positively that the adverse criticisms
were the results of venality, or ignorance, or want
of taste, or of that brutal conservatism which makes
Englishmen suspicious of everything not <a name='TC_7'></a><ins title="Was 'indorsed'">endorsed</ins>
by centuries of use and wont.</p>
<p>It may be easily seen how these personal irritations
made an unhappy atmosphere in which to
dwell. And Roland had another disappointment
also which he hardly liked to admit to himself&ndash;&ndash;Denasia
was changing so rapidly. The society into
which he himself had brought her forced the simple,
trustful, ignorant girl into observations and calculations
which lifted her unconsciously to a level,
perhaps in some respects to a plane above her husband.
She was naturally clever, and she learned
how to dress herself, how to take care of herself,
how to look out for her own interests. Roland
had intended to dictate to her, and she began to
smile at his dictations and to take her own way,
which she charmingly declared was the only reasonable
way for her to take.</p>
<p>During this interval Roland wrote often to Elizabeth.
He wanted some one to complain to, and
Elizabeth was the only person he knew who was
willing to listen to his complaints. She perceived
very early the little rift between husband and wife
which might be bridged by love or might become
an abyss in which love would be for ever lost. It
must, however, be noted to her credit that she
avoided any word likely to widen it. She did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
like Denasia, but she had a controlling sense of
honour. She had also a lofty ideal of the sacredness
of the marriage tie. To have made trouble
between a man and his wife would, in Elizabeth&rsquo;s
opinion, have been as wicked a thing as to break
into a church vestry and steal the sacramental
silver. But she did sympathize with her brother,
and advise him, and send him money. And naturally
Denasia, who thought badly of Elizabeth, resented
her interference in her life at all; so that
there was usually a coolness between Roland and
Denasia after the arrival of a letter from Burrell
Court.</p>
<p>In truth, any letter from St. Penfer at this period
of Denasia&rsquo;s life hurt her. She longed for her own
people. She felt heart-sick for a word from them.
In some moment of confidence or ill-temper, Roland
had given his wife his own version of the visit to
his mother-in-law. And whatever else he remembered
or forgot, he was clear and positive about
Joan&rsquo;s message to her daughter. She had broken
her good father&rsquo;s life in two and her mother was
sorry she had ever given her suck. Denasia knew
her mother&rsquo;s passionate nature, and she could understand
that some powerful aggravation had made her
speak so strongly, but the words, after all allowances,
were terrible words. They haunted her in the
midst of her professional excitements, and still more
in the solitude of her frequently restless nights.</p>
<p>And if Joan had felt this a year ago, Denasia
knew that she now felt much more bitterly; for in
one of her letters to Roland Elizabeth had written
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
freely of the passionate anger of John Penelles
when he learned that his daughter had become a
public dancer. Indeed, Elizabeth affected to think
it very cruel of Denasia to send to her old ignorant
parents the illustrated paper which contained her
picture in the dance act. She thought Denasia&rsquo;s
vanity had overstepped all bounds and become
positive cruelty, etc., etc. And Denasia, in a passion
which matched any outbreak of her father&rsquo;s,
vowed not only that she had never sent such a paper
to St. Penfer, but that Elizabeth herself must have
been the perpetrator of the cruelty, unless&ndash;&ndash;and she
then gave Roland a glance which made him wonder
where his willing and obedient Denasia of former
days had gone.</p>
<p>In all essential points this story was a false one.
It was indeed true that some person had sent to
the Penelles cottage a London paper, in which
there was a large picture of Denasia and the admiral
dancing the famous hornpipe. But the manner of
its reception was matter of speculation only, and
the speculative had founded their tale upon the
known hastiness of John and Joan&rsquo;s tempers, without
taking into consideration the presence of unknown
influences.</p>
<p>As it happened, the pictured girl was received in
the St. Penfer post-office during a storm. John had
been called in the grey dawn to the life-boat, and
Joan, in spite of wind and rain, went down to the
beach with him. With a prayer in her heart, she
saw him buckle on his buoyant armour and set
his pale blue oar like lance athwart his rest, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
then make straight out into the breakers that dashed
and surged around. Joan saw the boat&rsquo;s swift forward
leaping, its downward plunge into the trough
of the sea, its perilous uplifting, its perpendicular
rearing, its dread descent. And John felt its human
reel and shudder, its desperate striving and
leaping and plunging, and its sad submission when
the waters half filled it and the quivering men clung
for very life under the deluge pouring over them.</p>
<p>So for three hours John was face to face with
awful death, and Joan on her knees praying for his
safety, and John had but just got back to his home,
and the cry of thanksgiving for her old dear&rsquo;s return
was yet on Joan&rsquo;s lips, when the postman brought
the fateful newspaper. Fortunately they did not
open it at once. Joan laid it carefully aside and
brought on their belated breakfast. And as they
ate it they talked of the lives that were lost and
saved. Then John smoked his pipe, and Joan
tidied up her house and sat down beside him with
her knitting in her hands. Both their hearts were
solemn and tender. John felt as if his life was a
new gift to him; Joan, as if her husband&rsquo;s love had
some miraculous sweetness never known before.
They spoke seldom and softly, finding in their responsive
silence a language beyond words.</p>
<p>It was, then, in this gentle mood that John reached
to the shelf above his head and took down the
paper. He opened it, and Denas in her pretty dancing
dress, with her bare arms lifted above her head,
looked her father full in the face. She was laughing;
she was the incarnation of merriment and of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
consciously graceful, captivating vivacity. The miserable
father was, however, fascinated; he gazed
and gazed until his eyes overflowed, and his hands
trembled, and the paper fell with a rustle to the
floor.</p>
<p>Joan lifted it and looked at her husband. His
eyes were shut, he was sobbing inwardly as punished
children sob in sleep. She spoke to him, and he
opened his eyes and pointed to the paper. Then
Joan met the same well-beloved face. The mother&rsquo;s
cheeks burned red and redder, her eyes flashed, she
straightened out every crease, as if the pictured
satin and lace had been real; and then turning to
the printed page, she read aloud every word of adulation.</p>
<p>They had talked together of the men and women
drowned within sight of land that morning, but here
was their only child dancing in sight of eternal
death, and they could not say a word to each other
about her. For it must be remembered that these
simple, God-fearing fisher-folk had been strictly and
straitly reared in a creed which regarded dancing
as one of the deadly sins. They honestly believed
that there was but a step between their darling and
eternal death, and if she should take that step while
dancing! To have known that she was on the ship
which had just gone to pieces on the rocks would
not have made them so heart-sick. Their very souls
shivered as they thought of her. As for John, he
could find only those two words that spring instinctively
to every soul in trouble, &ldquo;O God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he motioned Joan to take the paper away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
and Joan took it into the room which was still
called &ldquo;Denas&rsquo; room.&rdquo; She kissed the pictured
face, the hair and eyes and mouth, the lifted arms,
the slender throat. She could not bear to crush
the paper together; she opened a drawer and laid
it as gently within as if she had been putting her
baby in its coffin. At this hour there was no
anger in her heart; there was even a little motherly
pride in her child&rsquo;s beauty and grace and cleverness.
At this extremity of ill-doing she did not altogether
blame Denas. She was certain that before Denas
danced, some one had somehow persuaded the girl
that it was not wicked to dance. &ldquo;Denas do have
principles,&rdquo; she said stiffly, &ldquo;and the man do not
live who can make her do wickedly if she do think
it be wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked with a sad affection around the little
room. How lonely it was! Yes, it is the living
who desert us that make lonely rooms, and not the
dead. We know the dead will never come back,
but oh, how long it seems to wait for the living!
Month after month to keep the room ready for the
one who does not come for our longing! Month
after month to dress the bed and the table, and lay
out the books they loved, and the little treasures
that may tell they were unforgotten. Joan looked
at the small dressing-table holding the shell box,
and the satin pincushion, and the alabaster vase
which Denas had once thought beautiful beyond
price. The snowy quilt and pillows, the carefully
kept floor and chairs, the clothing washed and laid
with sprigs of lavender in the tidy drawers&ndash;&ndash;oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
what poetry and eloquence of untiring, undespairing
mother-love were in these things!</p>
<p>But this patient, loving pity for their erring child
was an attitude not easily supposable, and Denasia
did not suppose it. She knew from Roland&rsquo;s report
that her appearance as a public singer had caused
her parents great sorrow and anger, and she could
only imagine a still deeper anger when she added
the sin of dancing to other causes of offence. But
this alienation from her own people was the bitter
drop in all her success and in all her pleasure.
For now that the illusions and selfishness of her
bride-days were past, the faithful home affection that
never wounded and never deceived resumed its importance,
and she longed for her father&rsquo;s kiss and
her mother&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>But every day the day&rsquo;s work is to face, and
Denasia&rsquo;s days were fully occupied by their obvious
duties. So week after week and month after
month wore on in alternations of hope and despair,
happiness and vexation, loving and quarrelling.
Roland certainly, with his discontent and abiding
sense of wrong, threw a perpetual shadow over life.
She did not even dare to take, with any show of
pleasure, such poor satisfaction as her passing fame
awarded. A man may be jealous of the praise given
to his own wife, and there were times when Roland
could not understand Denasia&rsquo;s success and his own
failure&ndash;&ndash;bitter hours in which the poor girl felt that
whether she pleased her audience or did not please
them, her husband was sure to be offended and angry.</p>
<p>She was almost glad when, at the close of the season,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
the company disbanded and she was at liberty
to retire. She had saved money and was resolved to
resume her studies. There was at least nothing in
that to irritate her husband, and she had a strong
desire to improve her talent in every direction.
One evening Roland entered their sitting-room in
that hurry of hope and satisfaction once common
enough to him, but of which he had shown little
during the past winter. Denasia looked up from
her writing with a smile, to meet his smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denasia,&rdquo; he cried impulsively, &ldquo;what do you
think? We are going to America! The United
States is the place for me. How soon can you be
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Roland? What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, dear. Whom are you writing to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was writing to Mr. Harrison and to madame.
I want to know if they are going to Broadstairs this
summer, for where they go I wish to go also; that
is, if they can give me lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A waste of money, Denasia. I have had a long
talk with some of the men who are here with the
American company. Splendid fellows! They tell
me that my Shakespearian ideas will set New York
agog. New Yorkers give every one a fair hearing;
at least &lsquo;there&rsquo;s nothing beats a trial!&rsquo; That is a
New York motto, and these people are sure I would
have a fair trial there. And the country is so big!
So big, Denasia, that the parts you know will last
you for years. There is not a bit of need for you
to study new songs and dances. Sing the old ones
in new places. Why, you may travel thousands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
of miles in all directions&ndash;&ndash;big cities everywhere,
little ones scattered thick as blackberries on all
the railroad routes, and railroad routes are spread
like spider-webs all over the United States! That
is the country for us! New York first of all, then
Chicago, St. Louis, Salt Lake, San Francisco, New
Orleans&ndash;&ndash;oh, hundreds of cities! And money, my
dear! Money for the picking up&ndash;&ndash;that is, for the
singing for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not believe a word of it, Roland. It is all
talk. I am going to Broadstairs to spend the summer
in study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland looked a moment at the handsome, resolute
woman who had resumed her writing, and he wondered
how this Denasia had sprung from the sweetly
obedient little maid he had once manipulated to
his will with a look or a word. However, he could
not spare her. It was not only her earnings he
required; her beauty and talent gave him a kind of
reflected importance, and he expected great things
from their united efforts in the wonderful new world
of which he had just begun to think.</p>
<p>So he set himself to win what it was evident he
could not command, and, Denasia&rsquo;s womanly instincts
being stronger than her artistic instincts, the
husband conquered. The sweet words and kisses,
the frank acknowledgment of his faults, the declaration
that his whole future hung now on her support
and interest in his American scheme, moved Denasia
to concede where she felt sure she ought to have
refused. But when a man finds all other arguments
fail with a woman, he has only to throw himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
upon her unselfishness. To prove it, she will ruin
her own life. Denasia was sure she was going a
wrong road, but then Roland asked her to take it
for his sake, and to show her love for him she
offered up her own hopes and desires, and offered
them with smiles and kind words and an affected
belief that the change might be as good for her reputation
as for her husband&rsquo;s. She did indeed&ndash;&ndash;as
good women do a kindness&ndash;&ndash;surrender herself entirely,
and pretended that the surrender was her own
desire and her husband&rsquo;s complaisance a thing he
deserved praise for.</p>
<p>However, Roland&rsquo;s enthusiasms were undoubtedly
partly contagious. Even Denasia, who had so often
been deceived, was partly under their influence. His
words had caught something of the vastness of the
land of his hopes, and he talked so ambitiously and
with so much certainty that the untravelled woman
caught his fever once more. Then she also suffered
the idea of America to fascinate her, and she permitted
Roland to bring his new friends to see her,
for she desired to be entirely possessed by the idea
which was now to be the ruling motive of their lives.
It was decided that they should sail about the middle
of June. &ldquo;We shall then have time to become
familiar with the country, and we need not be in a
hurry to decide about engagements. Hurry is such
a mistake,&rdquo; said Roland with oracular wisdom.
And Denasia hoped and smiled, and then turned
away to hide the sudden frown and sigh. For the
heart is difficult to deceive, and Denasia&rsquo;s heart
warned her morning, noon, and night. But to what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
purpose? Who heeds the warning from their higher
selves? Though one rose from the dead to point
out a fatal mistake, how many would heed the messenger?
For when love says, &ldquo;This is the way,&rdquo;
wisdom, fate, death itself may speak in vain.</p>
<p>About a week before the voyage, Roland said one
night: &ldquo;I think now, Denasia, that we have everything
packed, I shall run down to St. Penfer and
see my sister. I may never come back from America.
Indeed, I do not think I shall ever want to come
back, and I really ought to bid Elizabeth good-bye.
She will doubtless also remember me in money matters,
and in a strange country money is always a
good friend. Is it not, dear? What do you think,
Denasia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking a great deal of St. Penfer.
My heart is like to break when I think of it. I
do want to see my father and mother so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would only get a heart-break, my love.
They would have no end of reproaches for you. I
shall never forget your mother. Her temper was
awful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have said something awful to aggravate
her, Roland. Mother has a quick temper, but
it is also noble and generous. I do want to see
her. I must see her once more. Let us go together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To St. Penfer? What a foolish idea! You
would only give yourself a wretched memory to carry
through your whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind! I want to go to St. Penfer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you? I cannot take you to Burrell
Court, Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I would not put my foot inside Burrell Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if I went there and you went to your
father&rsquo;s house, that would look very bad. People
would say all kinds of wicked things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could stop together at the Black Lion.
From there you could call upon Elizabeth. From
there I could go to my father and mother. Even
if they should be cruel to me, I want to see them.
I want to see them. If father should strike me&ndash;&ndash;well,
I deserve it. I will kiss his hand for the
blow! That is how I feel, Roland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not permit my wife to go to any place
where she expects to be struck. That is how I feel,
Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are ashamed to take me to St. Penfer as
your wife. And yet you owe me this reparation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use discussing such a foolish statement.
I do not think I owe you anything, Denasia.
I have given you my name; at this very moment I
am considering your welfare. You know that money
is necessary, and as much of it as we can get; but
Elizabeth will give me nothing if you are tagging
after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going begging, Roland, that alters
the question. I have no desire to &lsquo;tag&rsquo; after you
on that errand. As for Elizabeth, I hate her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you hate her? She was always good
to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Do not name the woman. If you want
to go to her, go. I hope you will carry her nothing
but sorrow and ill-luck. I do! I do! I hate her as
the sailor hates the sunken reef. I have not asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
myself why. I only know that I have plenty of
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not be so excessive, Denasia. I shall leave
for the West to-night. Would you like me to see
your father? Your mother I decline to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave my father alone. You would not dare to
go near him. If you do I will never speak to you
again&ndash;&ndash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland laughed lightly at her passion and answered
with a provoking pleasantry: &ldquo;You feel too,
too, too furiously, Denasia. It is not ladylike.
Your emotions will wear away your beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Roland went by the night train to St. Penfer,
and Denasia took the train after his for the same
place. She was determined to see her parents once
more, and all their habits were so familiar to her
that she had no fear of accomplishing her desire
unknown to them. She timed her movements so
well that she arrived at a small wayside station
near St. Penfer about dusk. No one noticed her,
and she sped swiftly across the cliff-path, until it
touched the path leading downward to her own
home.</p>
<p>The little village was quite still. The children
had gone to bed. The men were at sea. The women
were doing their last daily duties. Denasia
kept well in the shadow of the trees till she was
opposite her home. A few steps across the shingle
would bring her to the door. She tried to remember
what her mother might be doing just at that
hour, and while thus employed Joan came to the
door, stood a moment on the threshold, and then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
went slowly to the next cottage. She had her
knitting in her hand, and she was likely going to
sit an hour with Ann Trewillow. When Joan&rsquo;s footsteps
no longer crunched the shingle there was no
sound but the ocean beating on the shore and the
wind stirring the tree-tops, and when Joan and Ann
Trewillow went inside Ann&rsquo;s cottage there was not
another human creature visible.</p>
<p>Swiftly, then, Denasia crossed the shingle. She
was at the door of her home. It stood wide open.
She entered and looked around. Nothing was
changed; the same glow of red fire on the white
hearth, the same order and spotless cleanliness, the
same atmosphere of love and peace and of life holy
and simple. She was not hungry, but she was very
thirsty and exceedingly weary. The bucket was
full of freshly drawn water; she drank and then
turned her face to her own room. A strong, sweet
curiosity tempted her to enter it, and its air of
visible welcome made her smile and weep. It was
then impossible to resist the desire that filled her
heart; she shut the door, she unclothed herself, and
once more lay down in her home to sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly likely mother comes into this room
more than once a week; she will not, at any rate,
come into it to-night. I shall hear her return and
go to bed. When she is asleep I will look once
more&ndash;&ndash;once more on her dear face. Father will be
home in the dawning. I will watch for his coming.
If he goes to bed at once I may get away before
any person sees me. If he sits and talks to mother,
I may hear something that will give me courage to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
say, &lsquo;I am here! Forgive me!&rsquo; I must trust to luck&ndash;&ndash;no,
no, to God&rsquo;s pity for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking thus, she lay in weary abandon on her
childhood&rsquo;s bed. The monotonous tick of the old
clock, the simmering of the kettle on the hob, and
the deep undertone of the ocean soothed her like
a familiar, unforgotten lullaby. In a few minutes
she had fallen into a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>She was asleep when Joan returned. Joan had
gone to her neighbour&rsquo;s to ask a question about the
boats, and she remained there for more than an
hour. For Ann Trewillow had heard of Roland&rsquo;s
arrival in the village, and she and Joan had some
opinions to express on the subject. So that when
Joan returned to her own cottage, it was with her
heart beating to memories of her daughter.</p>
<p>She put a little more coal on her fire and then
went for a drink of water. The tin cup was not in
its usual place, for Denas had left it on the table.
Joan looked at the cup with a face full of questions.
Had she left it there? She never before had done
such a thing. Who then had been in her house?
Who had been drinking from her water-bucket?
She asked the questions idly, without fear, but with
a certain curiosity as to her unknown visitor. Then
she put more water into the kettle and set a cup
and saucer for her husband in case he wanted a
drink of hot tea when he came in from the fishing.
All the time she was thinking of Denas, and the
girl seemed to grow into the air beside her; she
felt that if she whispered &ldquo;Denas&rdquo; she might hear
the beloved voice answer &ldquo;Mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>Unknown to any mortal, Joan had made a kind of
idol of the pictured Denasia. She was sorry for
her weakness in this matter, but she was not able
to resist the temptation of very frequently opening
the drawer in which it lay, of looking at it, and of
kissing it. Her conversation, her thoughts, her fancies
made her child-sick. She longed for a sight
of her darling&rsquo;s face, and she lifted a candle and
went to the door of the room in which it lay hidden.</p>
<p>There was always an unacknowledged sense of
self-indulgence in this act, and the sense made her
go a little softly about it, as if it had to be done
secretly. She opened the door slowly, and the rush
candle showed her clothing scattered about the
room. Her heart stood still; she was breathless;
she put down her light and on tiptoes went to the
bedside. Denas was fast asleep. Her long hair
lay loose upon the pillow, her face was pale and
faintly smiling, her hands open and at rest upon
the coverlet. Her deep, slow breathing showed her
to be far below conscious being, and Joan knelt
down at her child&rsquo;s side and filled her empty eyes
with the fair picture and her empty heart with the
hopes it inspired.</p>
<p>Still Denas slept. Then Joan went into the outer
room and sat down to wait for John. As the dawn
came up the East she pushed aside the foliage of
her flowering plants and watched the beach for
John&rsquo;s approach. He came on with his mates, but
they scattered to their cottages, and at last he was
alone. Then Joan went to the door and he smiled
when he saw her waiting. She made an imperative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
motion of silence; she took his string of fish and his
water-bottle out of his hands and laid them very
softly down, and while John was yet lost in amazement
at her actions, she put her hand in his and led
him to their girl&rsquo;s bedside. Without a word both
stood looking at her. The dawn showed every
change in her young face, and the pathos of hidden
suffering was revealed unconsciously as she slept.</p>
<p>There is some wonderful magnet in the human
eye; no sleeper can long resist its influence. As
John and Joan gazed steadily on their sleeping
daughter she, became restless, a faint flush flew to
her cheeks, she moved her hands. Joan slipped
down on her knees; when the girl opened her eyes
she was ready to fold her in her arms. John stood
upright, and it was his wide-open, longing gaze
which brought Denasia&rsquo;s soul back to her. She
gazed back silently into her father&rsquo;s face for a moment
and then murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! forgive me! Oh, mother! mother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They forgave her with tears of joy. They put
her fault out of words and out of memory. Confession
and forgiveness was an inarticulate service
of sorrow; but joy and welcome were eloquent and
full of tender words. For once John locked his
door and did not call his neighbours to share his
gladness. He speedily understood the shortness
and secrecy of her visit. After all, it was but a
farewell. The joy was dashed with tears. The
hope quickly faded away.</p>
<p>They did not try to turn her from the way she
had promised to go. John said only, &ldquo;The Lord go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
with you, Denas,&rdquo; and Joan wept at the thought
of the land so far, far off. But they divined that
their child had her own sorrows, that the lot of
woman had found her out, that she had come to
places where their love could not help her. Yet the
visit, short and unsatisfactory as it was, made a great
difference in Penelles&rsquo; cottage. It lifted much anxiety.
It gave the father and mother hopes which
they took to God to perfect, excuses which they
pleaded with Him to accept. Their confidence in
their child was strengthened; they could pray for
her now with a more sure hope, with a more perfect
faith.</p>
<p>When the gloaming came on thick with Cornish
fog Joan kissed her darling good-bye with passionate
love and grief, and John walked with his &ldquo;little
dear&rdquo; through the dripping woods to the wayside
station, and lifted her into the carriage with a great
sob. None of the three could have borne such
another day, but oh, how glad was each one that they
had dared, and enjoyed, and suffered through this
one! It left a mark on each soul that eternity
would not efface.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class='dropcap padtop'><span class="dcap">Roland</span> and Denasia were in Liverpool. They
were full of hopes and of prudent plans.
Roland had again turned over a new leaf; he had
renounced his past self&ndash;&ndash;the faults he could no
longer commit; he had renounced also his future
faults. If he was a little extravagant in every way
for a day or two before making so eventful a voyage,
he felt that Denasia ought not to complain.
Alas! it is not the renunciation of our past and
future selves that is difficult; it is the steady denial
of our present self which makes the disciple.</p>
<p>They spent two pleasant days in Liverpool, and
on the eve of the second went to the wonderful piers
and saw the vast companies of steamers smudging
the blue sky with their lowering clouds of black
smoke. Denasia clung closely to Roland; she felt
that she was going into a new world, and she looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
with a questioning love into his eyes, as if she
could read her fortune in them. Roland was unusually
gay and hopeful. He reminded his wife
that the mind and the heart could not be changed
by place or time. He said that they had each other
to begin the new life with, and he was very sure
they would soon possess their share of every other
good thing. And Denasia fell asleep to his hopeful
predictions.</p>
<p>In the morning all was changed. The sun was
hidden behind banks of black clouds, the streets
were plashy and muddy, the fierce showers smote
the windows like hail, and the view outside was
narrowed to a procession of dripping umbrellas. It
was chilly, too, and the hotel was inexpressibly
dreary and uncomfortable. Greatly to Denasia&rsquo;s
astonishment, Roland was already dressed. All his
hopes were fled. He was despondent and strangely
woe-begone and indifferent. He said he had had
a miserable dream. He did not think now it was
right to go to America; they would do nothing
there. He wished they were at Broadstairs; he
had been a fool to mind the chatter of men who
were probably guying him; he wished Denas had
not urged the plan; if she had only stood firm, etc.,
etc., etc.</p>
<p>Denasia looked at him with amazement and with
some anger. She reminded him that the American
idea was entirely his own. She wondered what
stuff he was made of, to be so dashed and quailed
by a dream. She said that she also had had a bad
dream. They had both eaten late; and as for dreams,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
everyone knew they went by contraries. And as
limp spirits like to lean, Roland was soon glad
to lean upon Denasia&rsquo;s bravery.</p>
<p>The few last weary hours in England went
slowly by. Roland and Denasia became at last impatient
to be off; any place must certainly be better
than that dreary hotel and that storm-beaten
town; the cab that took them to the wharf was a
relief, and the great steamer a palace of comfort.
They were not sick, and the storm was soon over.
After they lost sight of land the huge waves were
flatted upon the main; the weather was charming;
the company made a fair show of being intensely
happy, and day after day went past in the monotonous
pretension. Nothing varied the life until
the last night on board, when there was to be a concert.
Denasia had been asked to take a part in it,
and she had promised to sing a song.</p>
<p>No one expected much from her. She had not
been either officious or effusive during the voyage,
and &ldquo;song by Mrs. Tresham&rdquo; did not raise any
great expectations. As it was nearly the last item
on the programme, many had gone away before Roland
took his place at the piano and struck a few
startling chords. Then Mrs. Tresham stepped forward
and became suddenly Mademoiselle Denasia.</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Here beginneth the sea,</p>
<p>That ends not till the world ends,&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>thrilled the great ship&rsquo;s cabins from end to end.
The captain was within the door before the first
verse was finished. There was a crowd at the doors;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
all the servants in the lower saloon had ceased
work to listen. Song after song was called for.
Perhaps, indeed, Denasia had a sweeter taste of her
power that night than she had ever felt in halls
crowded with strangers who had paid a shilling to
be amused by her.</p>
<p>The listener most interested in this performance
said the least at the time; but he never took his
eyes off the singer, and his private decision was,
&ldquo;That young woman is a public singer. Her voice
has not been trained for parlours; she has been used
to fling its volume through the larger space of halls
or theatres. I must look after her.&rdquo; He approached
Roland the next day and spoke in guarded
terms about Mrs. Tresham&rsquo;s voice. Roland was
easily induced to talk, and the result was an offer
which was really&ndash;&ndash;if they had known it&ndash;&ndash;the open
door to fortune. But it is the fatality of the unlucky
to have the spirit of recklessness in their
veins and the weakness of prudence in their hearts.
Instead of letting events guide them, they have the
presumption to think they can guide events. Roland
received the offer coolly, and said he would
consult Mrs. Tresham on the matter. But, instead
of consulting with his wife, he dictated to her after
the fashion of the suspicious:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is the manager of a company, I think.
He is very anxious for you to sign an agreement.
His offer appears to be good, but we know nothing
of affairs in New York; it may be a very poor offer.
If you have made such an impression on him, you
may make a much more pronounced one on others.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
We will not think of this proposal at all, except as
the straw which shows us what a great wind is going
to blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denasia was extremely opposed to this view. She
quoted the old proverb of &ldquo;A bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush.&rdquo; She said it would be a
sure living during the time they were learning the
new country and its opportunities. She begged
Roland to let her accept the offer. When he refused,
she said that they would live to regret the
folly.</p>
<p>The manager thought so also. &ldquo;For you must
understand,&rdquo; he said to Roland, &ldquo;that I was desirous
to engage Mrs. Tresham, not for what she is&ndash;&ndash;which
is ordinary&ndash;&ndash;but for the possible extraordinary
I see in her if she could have the proper
advantages and influences.&rdquo; With the words he
bowed a little sarcastically to Mrs. Tresham&rsquo;s husband,
and afterward spoke no more to him. And
then there came to the foolish young man that sudden
chill and foreboding which a despised opportunity
leaves behind it.</p>
<p>But whether we do wisely or foolishly, the business
of life must be carried on. They were at the
point of landing, and for some days the strange experiences
of their new life occupied every moment
and every feeling. Then came a long spell of hot
weather, such heat as Denasia had never dreamed of.
Roland, who had been in Southern Europe, could endure
it better; as for Denasia, she lay prostrate with
but one idea in her heart&ndash;&ndash;the cool coverts of the
Cornish undercliff and the trinkling springs
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
where the blue-bells and the forget-me-nots grew
so thickly.</p>
<p>Yet it was necessary that something should be
done, and through the blazing heat, day after day,
the poor girl was dragged to agencies and managers.
But she found no one to make her such an offer as
the one so foolishly declined. And the time wore
on, and the money in their purse grew less and less,
and a kind of desperation made both silent and irritable.
Finally an engagement to go &ldquo;on the road&rdquo;
was secured, and Roland affected to be delighted
with it. &ldquo;We shall see the whole country,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and we can keep our eyes open for something
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denasia sighed. Disappointment and a sense of
wrong and grievous mistake filled her heart and sat
upon her face. She submitted as to an irreparable
injury, and left New York without the least enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Good fortune knocked at our door,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and we had not intelligence enough to let him
in.&rdquo; This was all the reproach she gave her husband,
and as she said &ldquo;we&rdquo; he accepted her generous
self-accusation, and finally convinced himself that
it was entirely Denasia&rsquo;s fault that the offer was
refused. &ldquo;But then I do not blame you, Denasia,&rdquo;
he remarked magnanimously; &ldquo;you had every right
to consider yourself worthy of a larger salary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left New York in September and went slowly
West. Denasia had a fine physique, but it was
not a physique trained to the special labour it had to
endure: long days in hot railway cars; hurry and
worry at every performance; no seclusion, no time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
for study; no time to acknowledge headache or weariness;
a score of little humiliations and wrongs; a
constant irritability at Roland&rsquo;s apparent indifference
to her wretchedness and apparent satisfaction
with the company and life into which he was thrown.
The men, indeed, all seemed satisfied. They had
cigars to smoke, and they told stories and played
cards, and so beguiled the weary hours of travel.
The women were headachy and tired; they soon threw
aside their paper novels and confidential talks.
Some of the very young ones&ndash;&ndash;pretty, wilful, inexperienced
girls, not yet disillusioned, not yet weary&ndash;&ndash;added
flirtation to their amusements. It pained
Denasia to see Roland a willing aid to their foolish
pastime. She had no fear that her husband would
wrong her, but the pretence pained and humbled her.</p>
<p>It was a wearisome seven months, a nightmare
kind of life, unrelieved by even a phantom show of
success. Men in the Sierras, out on the great Western
plains, knew not the sea. They could not be
roused to enthusiasm. Fisher-folk and fisher-life
were outside their sympathies. They preferred a
comic song&ndash;&ndash;a song that hit a famous person, or a
political principle, or a Western foible. Miners
liked to hear about &ldquo;Leadville Jim.&rdquo; It touched
their sensibilities when the &ldquo;Three Fishers who
Went Sailing out into the West&rdquo; made no picture
in their minds. Without being a failure, Denasia
could not be said to be a success. She was out of
her place, and consequently out of sympathy with all
that touched her life.</p>
<p>Coming back eastward, while they were at Denver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
Denasia was stricken with typhoid fever. It was the
result of months of unsatisfactory, unhappy labour,
of worry and fret and disappointment. Nostalgia
also of the worst kind had attacked her. She shut
her eyes against the great mountains and endless
plains. She wanted the sea. She wanted her home.
Above all, she wanted to hide herself in her mother&rsquo;s
breast. Roland had been frequently unkind to her
lately. She had been utterly unable to respond to
his moods, so different from her own, and she had
been more and more pained by the silly attentions
he bestowed on others.</p>
<p>At last she could endure it no longer. She had
come to a point of indifference. &ldquo;Leave me and let
me die.&rdquo; This was all she said when Roland was at
length forced to believe that her sickness was not
temper, or disappointment, or jealousy. The company
were compelled to leave her; Roland saw his
favourites on the train and then he returned to
nurse his sick wife. He found her insensible, and
she remained so for many days. Doctors were
called, and Roland conscientiously remained by her
side; but yet it was all alone that she fought her battle
with death. No one went with her into the dark
valley of his shadow. She was deaf to all human
voices; far beyond all human help or comfort.
Through the long nights Roland heard her moaning
and muttering, but it was the voice of one at an inconceivable
distance&ndash;&ndash;of one at the very shoal of
being.</p>
<p>She came back from the strife weak as a baby.
Her clear, shrill voice was a whisper. She could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
not lift a finger. It was an exhausting effort to
open her eyes. A new-born child was in every respect
more alive and more self-helpful, for Denasia
could not by look or whisper make a complaint or
a request. She was only not dead. The convalescence
from such a sickness was necessarily long and
tiresome. The fondest heart, the most unselfish
nature must at times have felt the strain too great
to be borne. Roland changed completely under it.
His love for Denasia had always been dependent
upon accessories pleasant and profitable to himself,
as, indeed, his love for any human being would
have been. While Denasia&rsquo;s beauty and talent gave
him <i>&eacute;clat</i> and brought him money, he admired
Denasia; and while her personality made sweet his
private and enviable his public hours, he loved her.</p>
<p>But a wife smitten by deathly sickness into
breathing clay&ndash;&ndash;a wife who could give him no delight
and make him no money&ndash;&ndash;a wife who
compelled him to waste his days in darkness and
solitude and unpleasant duties and his money in
medicines and doctor&rsquo;s fees&ndash;&ndash;was not the kind of
wife he had given his heart and name to. It was evident
to him that Denasia had failed. &ldquo;She has failed
in everything I hoped from her,&rdquo; he said to himself
bitterly one day, as he sat beside the still, death-like
figure; &ldquo;and there must be an end of this some
way, Roland Tresham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Financial difficulties were quickly upon him, and
though he had written to Elizabeth a most pitiful
description of his position, a whole month had
passed and there was no letter to answer his appeal.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
He had momentary impulses to run away from a
situation so painful and so nearly beyond his control.
But it was fortunately much easier for Roland
to be a scoundrel in intent than in reality.
His selfish instincts had some nobler ones to combat,
and as yet the nobler ones had kept the man
within the pale of human affections. There had
been one hour when the temptation was very nearly
too much for him; and that very hour there came
to him two hundred dollars from Elizabeth. It
turned him back. Ah, how many a time two hundred
dollars would prevent a tragedy! How many
a time financial salvation means also moral salvation!</p>
<p>It was midsummer before Denasia was strong
enough to return to New York, though she was passionately
anxious to do so. &ldquo;We are so far out of
the right way,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;So far! In New
York we are nearer home. In New York I shall
get well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And by this time Roland had fully realised how
unfit he was for the vivid, rapid life of the West.
The cultivated, gentlemanly drawl of his speech was
of itself an offence; his slow, unruffled movements
and attitudes, his &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; ways of thinking, his
conservatism and gentility and ultra-superficial
refinement were the very qualities not valued and
not needed in a community full of new life, ardent,
impulsive, rapid, looking forward, and determined
not to look backward.</p>
<p>So with hopes much dashed and hearts much
dismayed they re-entered New York. The question
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
of the future was a serious one. They were nearly
dollarless again, and even Roland felt that Elizabeth
could not be appealed to for some months at least.
Denasia was facing the sorrowful hopes of motherhood.
For three or four months she could not sing.
They restricted themselves to a small back room
in a Second Avenue boarding-house, and Roland
searched the agencies and the papers daily for something
suitable to his peculiar characteristics and
capabilities, and found nothing. There was a great
city full of people, but not one of them wanting the
services of a young gentleman like Roland.</p>
<p>As for Denasia, she was still very weak. July
and August tried her severely. Some few little
garments had to be made, and this pitiful sewing
was all she could manage. She did not lose her
courage, however, and if anything touched Roland&rsquo;s
best feelings at this time, it was her unfailing hope,
her smiling welcome no matter how frequently he
brought disappointment, her brave assurances that
she would be quite well before the winter season, and
then all would be put right.</p>
<p>In the last days of August the baby was born.
Denasia recovered rapidly, but the little lad was a
sickly, puny child. He had been wasted by fever,
and fretted by anxious cares and by many fears,
even before they were his birthright. All the more
he appealed to his mother&rsquo;s love, and Denasia began
now to comprehend something of the sin against
mother-love which she herself had committed.</p>
<p>Perhaps she permitted her joy in her child to
dominate her life too visibly; at any rate it soon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
began to annoy her husband. He had been so accustomed
to all of Denasia&rsquo;s time and attention that
he could not endure to be put off until baby was
asleep, or until some trifling want of baby&rsquo;s had
been attended to. He fancied that her attention
was divided; that even when she appeared to be
listening to his complaints or his intentions, her
heart was with the child and her ears listening for
its crying. The transient pleasure he had experienced
in the little one&rsquo;s birth soon passed away,
and an abiding sense of petty jealousy and wrong
took its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are for ever nursing that crying little creature,
Denasia,&rdquo; he said one day when he returned
to their small, warm room in a fever of annoyance
at some unappreciative manager. &ldquo;No one can get
your attention for five minutes. You hear nothing
I say. You take no interest in anything I do. And
the little torment is for ever and for ever crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby is sick, Roland. And who is there to care
for him but me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to be doing something. Winter is
coming on. Companies are already on the road; you
will find it hard to get a position of any kind, soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go out to-morrow. I am strong enough
now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can find nothing suitable. People seem to
take an instant dislike to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nonsense! You were always a favourite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had to sell most of my jewelry in order
to provide for your sickness, Denasia. Of course
I was glad to do it, you know that, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But it is my duty now, Roland. I will begin
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the next day Denasia went to the agencies, and
Roland promised to take care of baby. A two weeks
of exhausting waiting and seeking, of delayed hope
and destroyed hope, followed; and Denasia was
forced to admit that she had made no impression on
the managerial mind. No one had heard of her
singing and dancing, and those who condescended to
listen were not enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said one of the kindest of these
caterers for the public&rsquo;s pleasure&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;you see, New
Yorkers have no ideas about fisher men and women.
If their fish is fresh, that is all that troubles them.
If they think about the men who catch it, they very
likely think of them as living comfortably in flats
with all the modern improvements. A good topical
song, a spirited dance&ndash;&ndash;they are the things that
fetch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In different forms this was the general verdict,
and every day she found it harder and harder to
return home and meet Roland&rsquo;s eager face as she
opened the door. Pretty soon the anxiety became
tinctured with complaint and unreasonable ill-temper,
and with all the domestic miseries which accompany
resentful poverty.</p>
<p>The poor little baby in Roland&rsquo;s opinion was to
blame for every disappointment. Its arrival had
belated Denasia&rsquo;s application, or if he wanted to be
particularly irritating, he accused Denasia of being
in such a hurry to return to her child that she did
not attend to her most necessary duties. So instead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
of being a loving tie between them, the poor wailing
little morsel of humanity separated very love,
while Roland&rsquo;s complaints of it soon really produced
in his heart the impatient dislike which at first he
only pretended.</p>
<p>He grumbled when left in charge of the cradle.
As soon as Denasia was out of sight he frequently
deserted his duty, and the disputes that followed
hardened his heart continually against the cause of
them. And when it came to naming the child, he
averred that it was a matter of no importance to
him, only he would not have it called Roland.
&ldquo;There had been,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;one too many of the
Treshams called Roland. The name was unlucky;
and besides, the child did not resemble his family.
It looked just like the St. Penfer fisher children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denasia coloured furiously, but she answered
with the moderation of accepted punishment, &ldquo;Very
well, then! I will call him &lsquo;John&rsquo; after my father.
I hope he may be as good a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matters went on in this unhappy fashion until the
end of October&ndash;&ndash;nay, they continually grew worse,
for poverty deepened and hope lessened. Denasia
had lost the freshness of her beauty, and she was too
simple and ignorant to make art replace nature.
Indeed, it is doubtful whether any persuasion could
have made her imitate the &ldquo;painted Jezebel&rdquo; who
had always been one of the most pointed examples
of her religious education. In her first experience
of public life her radiant health and colouring
shamed all meaner aids and had been amply sufficient
for the brightest lights and the longest hours.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
But that fierce ordeal of acclimating under conditions
of constant travel and hard work had drained
even the magnificent vitality that had been her
heritage from generations of seamen, and typhoid
and unhappy maternity had robbed her of much of
her almost defiant youth, with its indomitable spirit
and invincible hope.</p>
<p>She had become by the close of October pale,
fragile-looking, and woefully depressed. Roland
no longer found her always smiling and hoping, and
he called the change bad temper when he ought to
have called it hunger. Not indeed hunger in its
baldest form for mere bread, but hunger just as killing&ndash;&ndash;hunger
for the nourishing delicate food and
proper tonics that were just as necessary as bread;
hunger for hope, for work, and, above all, hunger
for affection.</p>
<p>For Roland had begun privately&ndash;&ndash;yea, and sometimes
openly&ndash;&ndash;to call himself a fool. And the devil,
who never chooses a wrong hour, sent him at this
time an important letter from Elizabeth. In it she
told him that Mr. Burrell had died suddenly from
apoplexy, and that she had resolved to sell Burrell
Court and make her residence in London and
Lucerne. She deplored his absence, and said how
much she had needed some one of her own family
in the removal from Cornwall and in the settlement
of her husband&rsquo;s estate; and she sent her brother a
much smaller sum of money than she had ever sent
before.</p>
<p>When Roland had finished reading this epistle
he looked at Denasia. She was walking about the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
room trying to soothe and quiet the child. It was
very ill, and she had not dared to speak about a
doctor. Therefore she was feeling hurt and sorrowful,
and when Roland said, &ldquo;Elizabeth&rsquo;s husband is
dead,&rdquo; she did not answer him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said that Elizabeth&rsquo;s husband is dead,&rdquo; he
angrily reiterated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well. I am not sorry. I should think the
poor man would be glad to escape from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are speaking of my sister, Denasia&ndash;&ndash;of my
sister, who is a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing about her. She could always
take good care of herself. I am heart-broken for
my child, who is ill and suffering, and I can do
nothing for his relief&ndash;&ndash;no, not even get a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words still more bitter followed. Roland dressed
himself and went out. He was not in a mood to
do business or to look for business; indeed, there
was no need that he should trouble himself for one
day when he had Elizabeth&rsquo;s order in his pocket.
He turned it into cash, bought the daily newspapers,
and, the morning being exquisite, he took the cars to
Central Park. But it was not until he was comfortably
seated in the most retired arbour that he permitted
himself to think.</p>
<p>Then he frankly said over and over: &ldquo;What a
fool I have been! Here am I at thirty-three years
of age tied to a plain-looking fisher-girl and her
cross, sickly baby. All I hoped for in her has
proved a deception. Her beauty has not stood the
test of climate. Motherhood, that improves and
perfects most women, has personally wrecked her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Her voice is now commonplace. Her songs are
become tiresome. She has grown fretful, and all
her brightness and hopefulness have vanished. I do
not know how to make a living. I may as well admit
that my dramatic views are a failure&ndash;&ndash;that is, they
are in advance of the times. I can do nothing for
myself. But if I had not been married, what a
jolly time I might now be having with Elizabeth!
London, Paris, Switzerland, and no care or trouble
of any kind. Oh, what a fool I have been! How
terribly I have been deceived!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not take into consideration Denasia&rsquo;s disappointment.
He had no doubt Denasia was telling
all her own sorrows to herself and weeping over
them and her miserable little baby. After a while
he lit a fresh cigar and opened the newspapers.
For an hour or two he let his thoughts drift as they
led him, and then, as he was folding up one, the following
notice met his vision:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanted, a private secretary. A young man who
has had a classical education preferred. Call upon
Mr. Edward Lanhearne, 9 Fifth Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name struck Roland. He had heard it before.
It had a happy memory, an air of prosperity about
it. Lanhearne! It was a Cornish name! That circumstance
gave him the clew. When he was a boy
at Eton, he remembered a Mr. Lanhearne who stayed
with his father. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he cried, starting to
his feet, &ldquo;he was an American. What a piece of luck
it would be if it should be the same man!&rdquo; He
fixed the address in his mind and went to it immediately.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></div>
<p>The house pleased him. It was a large dwelling
fronting on the avenue. A handsome carriage was
just leaving the door, and in the carriage was a very
lovely young woman. The entrance, the reception
parlour, the servant who admitted him, all the apparent
accessories of the house and household indicated
wealth and refinement. What a heaven in
comparison with that back room on Second Avenue!
For the first time in many a month Roland had a
sense of success in what he was going to do, and the
feeling gave him a portion of the elements necessary
to success.</p>
<p>Mr. Lanhearne received him at once. He was a
kindly looking old gentleman, with fine manners and
an intelligent face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Tresham,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was attracted by
your name. I once had a friend&ndash;&ndash;a very pleasant
friend indeed, called Tresham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he live in London, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was Lord Mayor in the year 18--?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was. Did you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am his son. I remember you very well. You
went with me and my father to buy my first pony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did indeed. Mr. Tresham, sit down, sir. You
are very welcome. I am grateful for your visit.
And how is my old acquaintance? I have not
heard of him for many years. We are both Cornishmen,
and you know the Cornish motto is &lsquo;One and
all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is dead. He had great financial misfortunes.
He did not survive them long. I came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
to America hoping to find a better opening, but
nothing has gone well with me. This morning I
saw your advertisement. I think I can do all you
require, and I shall be very glad indeed of the position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in America, Mr.
Tresham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than a year. I went West at once, spent
my money, and failed in every effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. The West is for physical and financial
energies. I think if a young man is to rely on
his mental qualities he had better remain East. I
am glad you have called upon me. The duties I
wish attended to are very simple. You will have
to read my mail every morning and answer it as I
verbally direct. With the help of printed plates
you will arrange my coins and seals and such matters.
I wish you also to read the newspapers to me.
In a day or two you will find out which articles to
read and which to omit. I want a companion for
my drives. I want some one to chat with me on
my various hobbies&ndash;&ndash;a young man, because young
men have such positive opinions, and therefore we
shall be likely to come to pleasant disputing. You
will have a handsome room, a seat at my table, a
place among my guests, and one hundred dollars a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very grateful to you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am very grateful to the kind fate which
sent you to me. I owe your father for many a
delightful day. I am glad to pay my debt to his son.
When can you come here?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that. We dine at seven. I will expect
you to dinner. Do you&ndash;&ndash;ahem!&ndash;&ndash;excuse me, Mr.
Tresham, perhaps you may require a little money in
advance. I shall be pleased to accommodate you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You offer is gracious and considerate, sir. I
am glad you made it, although I do not fortunately
need to accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They clasped hands and parted with smiles. Mr.
Lanhearne was quite excited over the adventure.
He longed for his daughter to come home, that he
might tell her what a romantic answer had come
to his prosaic advertisement. And Roland was still
more excited. The air of the house, its peace,
refinement, and luxury appealed irresistibly to him.
It was his native air. He wondered how he had
endured the vulgarity and penury of his surroundings
for so long; how indeed he had borne with
Denasia&rsquo;s shortcomings at all. That refined old
gentleman, that quiet, elegant woman whom he had
had a glimpse of&ndash;&ndash;these people were like himself,
of his own order&ndash;&ndash;he would never weary of them.
The class he had voluntarily chosen, the people
with whom poverty had compelled him to consort,
they affected him now as the memory of a debauch
affects a man when it is over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no business out of my proper sphere,&rdquo; he
said sadly. &ldquo;Elizabeth was right&ndash;&ndash;right even
about Denasia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat down in Union Square to consider his position,
and he came to a very rapid and positive conclusion.
He declared to himself: &ldquo;I will no longer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
waste my life. Denasia and I have made a great
mistake. Together, we shall be poor and miserable.
Apart, we shall be happy. I no longer love
her. I do not believe she loves me. All the love
she can spare from her blustering father and mother
she wastes on that miserable sickly babe, who would
be a thousand times better dead than alive. If I
leave her she will go back to St. Penfer. I have
a hundred dollars; I will give her fifty of them.
She can pay a steerage passage out of it or go in a
sailing-vessel, or if she does not like that way she
has things she can sell. If I give her half of what
I have I do very well indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went rapidly to his home, or room. He knew
that Denasia had an engagement to keep, and he
hoped that he might be fortunate enough to find her
out. It was as he wished: Denasia had gone out
and the landlady was sitting beside the baby&rsquo;s
cradle. Roland dismissed her with that manner
all women declared to be charming, and then he sat
down and wrote a letter to his wife. It did not
occupy him ten minutes. Some of his clothing was
yet very good and fashionable; he packed it in the
leather trap which had gone with him to college,
and then he sent a little girl for a cab. Without
word and without observation he drove away from
the scene of so much vexation and disappointment.</p>
<p>The whole life and vicinity had suddenly become
horrible to him&ndash;&ndash;Denasia, his child, the shabby
landlady, the shabby house, the dirty little grocery
at the corner where he had bought his cigars and
their small household supplies, the meals cooked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
there and eaten there, Denasia&rsquo;s attempts at housekeeping&ndash;&ndash;the
whole series of memories made him
wince and shiver with shame and annoyance.
&ldquo;Thank God it is over!&rdquo; he said fervently. And
he never once thought what an insult he was offering
to eternal mercy and justice, in supposing God
had anything whatever to do with his flagrant desertion
of duty, his shameful abrogation of all the consequences
of his own wilful selfishness, and his cruel
farewell to the wife and son he was bound to nourish
and cherish and defend.</p>
<p>He thought of none of these things. He thought
only of the comfort and elegance; the peace, the
delicate living, the delicate clothing, the congenial
companionship he was going to. He was determined
to have a luxurious bath, to be shaved and
perfumed, to leave behind him the very dust of his
past life. He resolved not to allow himself to
remember Denasia. She was to be as if she never
had been. He would blot out of his memory all
the years she had brightened and darkened. And
if any excuse can be found for him, it must be in his
supposition that Denasia felt just as he did. She
would be grateful to him for taking the initiative&ndash;&ndash;glad
to get back to her home and her people, glad
to escape a life for which she must have discovered
she had neither strength nor vocation.</p>
<p>So he thought, in spite of his resolve not to think.
But a man must be even more selfish and reckless
than Roland was to take years of his past life and
plunge them into oblivion as he would plunge a
stone into mid-ocean. In spite of the novelty of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
his situation, of his delight with his quiet, handsome
room, the thought of Denasia would enter
where it was forbidden to enter, and he could not
help wondering how she would receive his letter,
and what steps she would take in consequence of it.</p>
<p>Denasia came home weary and disappointed. She
had had a long, silent wait for the person she expected
to see, and finally been compelled to accept
the fact that he was not coming into town. She
was heart-sick, and the paltry loss of the car fare
was an addition to her anxiety. That the room was
empty and the baby crying did not in any way
astonish her. She understood from it that Roland
had come home and dismissed the landlady, and
then wearied of his watch and gone out again, leaving
the child to sleep or to weep as it felt inclined to
do. Her first action was to lift it from its bed, nurse
and comfort it, and rock it to sleep on her breast.</p>
<p>Then her eyes wandered from her child to a letter
lying on the table. The circumstance roused no
interest in her mind. She knew from its general
appearance that it had been put there by Roland,
and it was by no means the first time he had left the
child with a letter containing some excuse which he
thought valid enough to satisfy Denasia. She looked
at it with a little contempt. She expected to find it
assert that some one had called for him or had
sent him a message involving a possible engagement,
and she knew the whole affair would resolve
itself into some plausible story, which she would
either have to accept or else deny, with the certain
addition of a coolness or a quarrel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></div>
<p>So the letter lay until she had put off and away
her street costume. Then she took it in her hand
and sat down by the open window to read the contents.
They were short and very much to the point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Denasia, my dear</span>:&ndash;&ndash;You have ceased to love me
and I have ceased to love you. You are miserable
and I am miserable. We have made a great mistake,
and we must do all we can to correct it. When you
read this I shall be on my way to England. I advise
you to go back to your parents for a year. You
may in that time recover your beauty and your voice.
It may be well then to go to Italy and give yourself
an opportunity to obtain the education I see
now you ought to have had at the first. But until
that is practicable we are better apart. You will
find fifty dollars in the white gloves lying on the
dressing-case. I advise you to take a sailing-vessel;
a long voyage will do you good and will be much
cheaper. It is what I have done. Farewell.</p>
<p class='closing sig2'>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Roland.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She read every word and then glanced at the cradle.
The child moved. With the letter in her hand
she soothed it and then sat down again. She was
overwhelmed with the shameful wrong. But to cry
out and wring her hands and call in the neighbours
to see and hear what things she suffered was not her
way. Often she had seen her mother sitting speechless
and motionless for hours while her father hung
between life and death; it was natural for Denasia
to take unavoidable sorrow with the same dumb
patience.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>Then she began to analyse the specious sentences
and to deny the things asserted. &ldquo;I have not ceased
to love. Every hour of the day my life has been
a witness to my love. I never said I was miserable.
Nothing had power to make me quite miserable if
Roland was kind to me. He is on his way to
England. Of course he has gone to his sister.
What did her sweet complaints and regrets at not
having his help and company mean but &lsquo;Come to me,
Roland&rsquo;? She has lost her own husband and now
she must have mine. She has always been my evil
angel. When she was kindest to me it was only a
different way of serving herself. My soul warned
me; my father warned me. She is one of those
human vampires who suck love, luck, life itself
from all near them, and who slay, and rob, and
smile, and caress while they do it. And I am to go
home for a year and get back my beauty and my
voice. I am sorry I ever was beautiful. If I can
help it I will never sing another song. Go home
and shame my good father and mother for his sake?
Go home and be lectured and advised and reproved
by every woman in the village? Go home a deserted
wife, a failure in everything? No; I will not go
home. Nor will I go to Italy. I have had more
than enough of singing for my living and his living,
too. I will sew, I will wash, I will go to service, I
will do anything with my hands I can do; but I
will not sing. And I will bring up my boy to work
at real work, if it is but to make a horseshoe out of
a lump of iron! God! what a foolish woman I
have been! What a silly, vain, loving woman! My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
heart will break! My heart will break! Alone,
alone! Sick, helpless, ignorant, alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and hid her face, and in that
darkness gathered together her soul-strength. But
she shed no tears. Pale as death, weak and trembling
with suppressed emotion, she went softly about
the little room putting things in order&ndash;&ndash;doing she
scarcely knew what, yet feeling the necessity to be
doing something. Thus she came across the white
gloves, and she feared to look in them. Her knowledge
of Roland led her to think he would not leave
fifty dollars behind him. He would take the credit
of the gift and leave her to suppose herself robbed
by some intruder or visitor.</p>
<p>So she looked suspiciously at the bit of white
kid and undid it without hope. The money was
there. After all, Roland had some pity for her.
The sight of the bills subdued her proud restraint.
One great pressure was lifted. No one could now
interfere if she sent for a doctor for her sick baby.
She could at least buy it the medicine that would
ease its sufferings. And so far out was the tide of
her happiness that from this reflection alone she
drew a kind of consolation.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">The</span> Lanhearnes by an old-fashioned standard
were a very wealthy family. They were also a
large family, though the sons had been scattered by
their business exigencies and the eldest daughters
by marriage. Only Ada, the youngest child of the
house, remained with her father; for the mother had
been dead many years, and the preservation of the
idea of home was felt by all the Lanhearne children
to be in Ada&rsquo;s hands. If she married and went
away, who then would keep open the dear old house
and give a bright welcome to their yearly visits?</p>
<p>Ada, however, was not inclined to marriage.
She was a grave, quiet woman of twenty-two years
of age, whose instincts were decidedly spiritual
and whose hopes and pleasures had little to do with
this world. She was interested in all church duties
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
and in all charitable enterprises. Mission schools
and chapels filled her heart, and she paid out of her
private purse a good-hearted little missionary to
find out for her cases of deserving poverty which it
was her delight to relieve.</p>
<p>Roland had never before come in contact with
such a woman, and at a distance he gave her a kind
of adoration. Young, beautiful, rich, and yet keeping
herself unspotted from the world or going into
it only to relieve suffering, to dry the tears of
childhood, and strengthen the failing hearts of unhappy
women. Once while walking with Mr. Lanhearne
the old gentleman said: &ldquo;This is Ada&rsquo;s
church. As the door is open let us enter and wait
for prayers.&rdquo; So out of the rush and crush of Broadway
the old and the young man turned into the
peace of the temple. And as they entered Ada
rose up from before the altar, and with a pale, rapt
face glided into the solitude of her own pew.
Neither spoke of the circumstance, but on Roland&rsquo;s
mind it made a deep impression. At that hour he
realised how beautiful a thing is true religion and
how holy a thing is a woman pure of heart, calmly
radiant from the very presence of God.</p>
<p>In spite of the unhappy memories of the past, in
spite of the worrying thoughts which would intrude
concerning Denasia, he was not at this time very
happy. Certainly not happy enough to contemplate
a long continuance of the life he was leading, but
well satisfied to pass the winter in its refined and
easy seclusion. He knew that Elizabeth would be
in London until June, and he resolved to remain in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
New York until she left for Switzerland. He would
then join her at Paris and spend the summer and
autumn in her company; beyond that he did not
much trouble himself.</p>
<p>He had, indeed, a vague dream of then quietly
visiting Denasia and determining whether it would
be worth while to educate her for grand opera. For
the idea had taken such deep root in his mind that
he could not teach himself to regard the future
without it, and now that Elizabeth had full control
of her riches, he did not contemplate any difficulty
about money matters. He still believed in Denasia&rsquo;s
voice, and he had seen that her dramatic talents
were above the average; so even in the charmed
atmosphere of the Lanhearne home, he could still
think with pleasure of being the husband of a famous
prima donna.</p>
<p>He was sure that Denasia had returned to St.
Penfer. He knew that ever since they came to
America she had written at intervals to her parents,
and though it was indeed a labour of love for either
John or Joan to write a letter, Denasia had had several
communications from them. Evidently, then,
she had been forgiven, and he had no doubt that for
the sake of her child she hurried homeward as soon
as it was possible for her to secure a passage.</p>
<p>Still he allowed three weeks to pass ere he made
any inquiries. During those three weeks his own
life had settled into very easy and pleasant ways.
He breakfasted alone or with Mr. Lanhearne.
Then he read the morning papers aloud and attended
to the mail. If the weather were favourable, this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
duty was followed by a stroll or drive in the park.
Afterward he was very much at leisure until dinner-time,
and at nine o&rsquo;clock Mr. Lanhearne&rsquo;s retirement
to his own room gave him those evening hours
which most young men consider the desirable ones.
Roland generally went to some theatre or musical
entertainment. There was always the vague expectation
of seeing and hearing Denasia, and he
scarcely knew whether his disappointment was a
pleasure or an annoyance.</p>
<p>At the end of the third week he ventured to the
Second Avenue house. The room they had occupied
was dark. He watched it until midnight. If
Denasia had been singing anywhere, she would certainly
have returned to her child before that hour.
The next night he sent a messenger to inquire for
her address, and the boy said, &ldquo;It was not known.
Mrs. Tresham had left two weeks before. She had
spoken of England, but it was not positively known
that she had gone there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is likely in St. Penfer by this time,&rdquo; mentally
commented Roland, and the thought gave him
comfort. He did want Denasia and the baby to be
taken care of, and he knew they would want no
necessary thing in John Penelles&rsquo; cottage. But it
was this very certainty of Denasia&rsquo;s return to
England which really detained Roland in America.
He had no desire to meet John Penelles until time
had healed the wound he had given John&rsquo;s daughter.
John would be sure to seek him out in London, and
there might be no end of trouble; but John would
not come to America, nor would he be likely in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
summer season to leave the fishing and seek him
either in Paris or Switzerland. As for Elizabeth,
she knew from her brother&rsquo;s letters that he had
deceived and left his wife, and she had, of course,
thought it proper to offer a feeble remonstrance,
but Roland knew right well she would never betray
his hiding-place.</p>
<p>So Roland lived on week after week in luxurious
thoughtlessness. Mr. Lanhearne grew very fond of
him, and Ada, in spite of her numerous objects of
charitable interest, found it singularly pleasant to
discuss with so handsome and intelligent a companion
religious topics on which their opinions were
widely apart. Indeed, she honestly accepted the
evident duty of leading him back to the safe and
narrow road of creditable dogmas. And with such
a fair, earnest teacher it was easy, it was natural
for Roland to affect an interest in the subject he
did not really feel.</p>
<p>Dangerous ground for both, but especially so for
the lovely young woman whose sincerity and singleness
of purpose led her to believe that a very natural
and womanly instinct was the prompting of a spiritual
concern for an immortal soul wandering from
the right path. Roland as a hypocrite, affecting a
piety he despised, would not have been either so
captivating or so dangerous as Roland honestly
ignorant and doubtful, yet willing to be taught and
convinced.</p>
<p>Dangerous ground for both, for both constantly
assured themselves there was no danger. Ada Lanhearne
was not a woman that any man could approach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
with laughter or half-concealed flirtation. And
Roland had no desire to overstep the boundary her
noble presence inspired. Also, Denasia held him
by the mysterious strength of the marriage tie.
Apart from her and relieved of the petty cares
which degraded their love, he forgot her shortcomings
and thought more and more frequently of her
affectionate, forgiving heart. The radiance of her
youthful beauty was still in his memory, and the
haunting charm of her voice called him at all kinds
of incongruous hours. He awoke at night with the
silvery cry of &ldquo;Caller Herrin&rsquo;&rdquo; in his ears. At the
dinner-table he heard her light musical laugh ring
through the decorous, quiet room, and often when
discussing an old Roman coin with Mr. Lanhearne
he felt her hand upon his shoulder, and feared to
turn lest her face should confront him.</p>
<p>Ada&rsquo;s beaming eyes, and soft voice, and mystical
rapture of holy enthusiasm touched him on quite
a different side of his nature. She made him long
to be good&ndash;&ndash;he was almost afraid he would become
good if he dwelt too much in her presence. And
he did not desire to be so&ndash;&ndash;not just yet. But as
she talked so earnestly to him of righteousness, and
duty and the life to come, it was impossible that
he should not in some way respond. And when his
handsome eyes were shadowed with feeling and his
gay face and manner subdued to the gravity of the
subject, it was equally impossible for the young
teacher not to be moved by the evidences of her
own eloquent persuasion.</p>
<p>After all, much must be left to the imagination;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
the situation was so full of possibilities, so absolutely
free of all wrong conditions, so ready to yield
itself to many wrong conditions. Roland&rsquo;s days
went by in a placid sameness, which did not become
fretting, because he knew he should end its pleasant
monotony of his own free will in a very few weeks.
And Ada had never before been so happy. Why
should she ask herself the reason? To question
fate is not a fortunate thing, at any rate; she felt a
reluctance to begin a catechism with her feelings
or her surroundings.</p>
<p>So the Christmas came and went, and the days
lengthened and the cold strengthened, and there
was so much misery among the poor that Ada&rsquo;s
time and money were taxed to their uttermost use
and ability. And the suffering she saw left its
shadow on her fair face. She was quieter because
her thoughts were deep in her heart and did not
therefore readily resolve themselves into words.
The mystery of the whole creation suffering together
oppressed and solemnized her life, for it was no
hearsay of cold, and hunger, and wretchedness that
touched Ada. She sat down on the cold hearths
with broken-hearted wives and mothers, and held
upon her knees the little children ready to perish.
Money she gave to the uttermost, but with the
money something infinitely more precious&ndash;&ndash;love,
like that which made the Christ put His hand upon
the leper as well as heal him; womanly sympathy,
which listened patiently to tales of intolerable
wrongs and to the moans of extreme physical
suffering.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>In her own home she seldom spoke of these experiences.
Mr. Lanhearne did not altogether approve
of them. Like the centurion of old, he thought it
was sufficient to &ldquo;speak the word only,&rdquo; that is, to
give the money necessary to relieve suffering. And
he did not see why his child&rsquo;s life should be shadowed
by carrying the griefs of others. So there was very
seldom any talk on these matters, unless Ada required
assistance. Then she spoke with such clear
sincerity and pathos that her father felt it to be a
privilege to be her right hand, and for the time
being was probably as enthusiastic as herself. But
these were rare occasions; Ada was too wise and
considerate to stretch a generous or a gentle emotion
until it failed.</p>
<p>One bitterly cold night in February Roland returned
to Lanhearne House in a particularly unhappy
mood. He had been down-town as far as Twenty-third
Street, and had been subjected to all the
depressing influences of the cold, brown-stony city,
swept by that most cruel of winds&ndash;&ndash;the east wind
which comes with a thaw. The sullen poor, standing
desperate and scornful at the street corners,
seemed to cast a malevolent eye upon his handsome,
well-clothed person. There had been a terrible
accident, followed by a fire, somewhere in the city,
and the raw, cutting air was full of its horror. As
he passed a group of men, a poor shivering creature
said passionately, &ldquo;Accident indeed! All accidents
are crimes!&rdquo; The friction of the interests
and wills encompassing him evolved an atmosphere
which he had no strength to antagonise. He simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
submitted to its worry and restlessness and unhappy
discontent, and so carried the spirit home with him.</p>
<p>It was met on the threshold by influences that
drove it back into the desolate street. The warm,
light house and the peace and luxury of his own
room soothed his mental sense of something wrong.
And when he descended to the parlour, he was
instantly encompassed by soft warmth, by firelight
and gaslight, by all the visible signs and audible
sounds of sincere pleasure in his advent. Mr. Lanhearne
had a new periodical to discuss, and Ada,
though unusually grave, lifted her still face with
the smile of welcome on it.</p>
<p>She had, however, an evident anxiety, and Mr.
Lanhearne probably divined its origin, for after
dinner was over he said: &ldquo;Ada, I saw your little
missionary here, late. Is there anything very
wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going to tell you, father. Mr.
Tresham may listen also, it can do him no harm.
Mrs. Dodge came to tell me of a most distressing
case. She was visiting an old patient in a large
tenement, and the woman told her to call at the
room directly above her. As she went away she
did so. It was only four o&rsquo;clock then, but in that
place quite dark. When she reached the door she
heard a voice praying&ndash;&ndash;heard a voice thanking God
amid sobs and tears&ndash;&ndash;oh, father, what for? For the
death of her baby! Crying out in a passion of
gratitude because it was released from hunger and
cold and suffering!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lanhearne covered his face, and Roland
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
looked at Ada with his large eyes troubled and
misty. The girl was speechless for a moment or
two, and Roland watched her sympathetic face and
saw tears drop upon her clasped hands. Then she
resumed: &ldquo;Mrs. Dodge entered softly. The mother
was sitting on a chair with her dead baby across her
knees. There was no fire, no candle in the room,
but the light from an oil-lamp in a near window
fell upon the white faces of the mother and her
dead child. There is no need to tell you that Mrs.
Dodge quickly made a fire, cooked the poor famished
creature a meal, and then prepared the dead child
for its burial. But she says the mother is distracted
because she cannot buy it a grave and a
coffin. I have promised to do that; you will help
me, father? I know you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure I will, Ada. To be sure, my dear
one! I will help gladly. Has the poor, sorrowful
woman no husband to comfort her in this extremity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says he is dead. Her history is a little out
of the common. She is an English woman and was
a public singer. The name she is known by is
Mademoiselle Denasia&ndash;&ndash;but that, of course, is not
her real name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A quick, sharp cry broke from Roland&rsquo;s lips. He
was grey as ashes. He trembled visibly and stood
up, though his emotion compelled him instantly to
reseat himself. He was on the point of losing consciousness.
Mr. Lanhearne and Ada looked at him
with anxiety, and Mr. Lanhearne went to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am better,&rdquo; he said with a heavy sigh. &ldquo;I
knew&ndash;&ndash;I knew this poor woman! I told you I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
once on the road with a company. She was in it.
Her husband was a brute&ndash;&ndash;a mean, selfish, cowardly
brute&ndash;&ndash;he ought to be dead. I should like to help
her&ndash;&ndash;to see her&ndash;&ndash;what is the street? the number?
Excuse me&ndash;&ndash;I was shocked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, Mr. Tresham,&rdquo; answered Ada, kindly.
She had some ivory tablets by her side, and she
looked at them and said, &ldquo;It is a very long way&ndash;&ndash;One
Hundred and Seventieth Street&ndash;&ndash;here is the
address. I shall be glad if you can do anything to
help. I am sure she is worthy&ndash;&ndash;she has had good
parents and been taught to pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Ada,&rdquo; said Mr. Lanhearne, &ldquo;sorrow
forces men and women down upon their knees; even
dumb beasts in their extremity cry unto God, and
He heareth them. And as for being worthy of help&ndash;&ndash;if
worthiness were the condition, which of us
durst pray for consolation in the hour of our trouble?
God has a nobler scale. He sends his rain upon the
just and the unjust, and He never yet asked a suppliant,
&lsquo;Whose son art thou?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland was grateful for this little discussion. It
gave him a minute or two in which to summon his
soul to face the position. He was able when Mr.
Lanhearne ceased speaking to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Denasia is a Cornish woman. She
comes from a village not far from where my father
lived. I feel that I ought to stand by her in her
sorrow. I shall be glad to do anything Miss Lanhearne
thinks it right to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject was then dropped, but Roland could
take up no other subject. With all his faults, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
was still a creature full of warm human impulses.
There was nothing of the cold, calculating villain
about him. He was really shocked at the turn
events had taken. Mr. Lanhearne, who knew the
world of men which Ada did not know, mentally
accused his handsome, sympathetic secretary of some
knowledge of the unfortunate singer which it would
be best not to investigate; but Ada thought his emotion
to be entirely the outcome of an unusually tender
and affectionate nature.</p>
<p>The incident affected the evening unhappily.
Roland was not able either to talk or read, and Mr.
Lanhearne, out of pure sympathy for the miserable
young man, retired to his own apartment very early.
This was always the signal for Roland&rsquo;s dismissal,
and five minutes after it Mr. Lanhearne, looking
from his window into the bleak, wind-swept street,
saw Roland rapidly descend the steps and then turn
northward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure of it,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;There is
more in this affair than meets the ear, but I like
the young man, and why should I rake among the
ashes of the past? Which of us would care for an
investigation of that kind?&rdquo; Then he sat down
before his fire and mentally followed Roland to the
bare loneliness of that poor home where death and
the mother sat together.</p>
<p>For once Roland feared to call, &ldquo;Denasia!&rdquo; He
hesitated at the foot of the narrow stair and then
went softly to the door. All within was still as
the grave, but a glimmer of pale light came from
under the ill-fitting door. He might be mistaken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
in the room, but he resolved to try. He turned the
handle and there was an instant movement. He
went forward and Denasia stood erect, facing him.
She made no sound or sign of either anger, or astonishment,
or affection. All her being was concentrated
on the clay-cold image of humanity lying so
strangely still that it filled the whole place with
its majesty of silence.</p>
<p>He closed the door softly and said &ldquo;Denasia!
Oh, Denasia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not answer him, but sinking on her knees
by the child, began to sob with a passionate grief
that shook her frail form as a tree is shaken by a
tempest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest! My wife! Forgive me! Forgive
me! I thought you were in St. Penfer. As God
lives, I believed you were with your mother. I
intended to come to you, I did, indeed! Denasia,
speak to me. I will never leave you again&ndash;&ndash;never!
We will go back to England together. I will
make you a home there. I will love and cherish
you for ever! Forgive me, dear! I am sorry! I
am ashamed of myself! I hate myself! I do not
wonder you hate me also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I do not hate you, Roland. I am lost
in sorrow. I cannot either love or hate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me bear the sorrow with you, coward, villain
that I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not mean to be either. You were tired
of misery&ndash;&ndash;men do tire. I would have tired, too,
only for my baby. Oh, Roland! Roland! Roland!
my love, my husband!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>Then&ndash;&ndash;ah, then. No one can put into mere common
words the great mystery of forgiveness. It is
not in words. Heart beat against heart, eyes gazed
into eyes, souls met upon clinging lips, and the
sweet compact of married love was renewed in the
clasping of their long-parted hands. They sat
down together and spoke in soft, sad voices of the
great mistakes of the past. Until the midnight hour
they wept and talked together, and then Denasia
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a short time a poor woman who is nursing at
the Gilsey House will be here. She is on duty
until twelve o&rsquo;clock, but as soon as she is released
she promised to come and sit with me. So you
must leave me now, Roland. It is useless to explain
to my neighbours our relationship. They
would look at you and me and think evilly. I
would not blame them if they did. When all is
over I will come to you; until then I will remain
alone. It is best so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless Roland lingered and pleaded, and
when he finally consented to her wish, he left all
the money he had in her hands. She looked at the
bills with a sad despair. &ldquo;All these!&rdquo; she whispered,
&ldquo;all these for a grave and a coffin! There
was nothing at all to help him to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could have saved him, Denasia. He
was born under sentence of death. He has been ill
all his poor little life. My darling, believe that it
is well with him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet her words and tears troubled him, and he
bade her good-night, and then returned so often that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
the woman Denasia had spoken of passed him in
the narrow entry, and he paused and watched her
go to his wife&rsquo;s room. Even then he did not hurry
to his own home. He went down the side street,
and stood looking at the glimmering lamp in the
sorrowful place of death until he became painfully
aware of the terribly damp, cold wind searching
out and chilling life, even to the very marrow of the
bones. Then he remembered that he had come out
in his dress boots, consequently his feet were wet
and numb, and he had a fierce pain under his shoulder.
A sudden, uncontrollable fear went to his heart
like a death-doom.</p>
<p>He had to walk a long way before he found any
vehicle, and when, after what seemed a never-ending
period of torture, he reached his room, he knew
that he was seriously ill. But the house had settled
for the night; he had a reluctance to awaken the servants;
he hoped the warmth would give him ease;
he was, in fact, quite unacquainted with the terrible
malady which had seized him. In the morning he
did not appear, and after a short delay Mr. Lanhearne
sent him a message.</p>
<p>Roland was, however, by this time in high fever
and delirious. The news caused a momentary hesitation
and then a positive decision. The hesitation
was a natural one&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Should not the young man be
sent to the hospital?&rdquo; The decision came from the
cultivated humanity of a good heart&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;No. Roland
was &lsquo;the stranger within the gates,&rsquo; he was a countryman,
he was more than that, he was a Cornishman.&rdquo;
In a few moments Mr. Lanhearne had sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
for his own physician and a trained nurse, and he
went himself to the side of the sick man until help
arrived.</p>
<p>Toward night Roland became very restless, and
with a distressing effort constantly murmured the
word &ldquo;Denasia.&rdquo; Mr. Lanhearne thought he understood
the position exactly, and he had a very pardonable
hesitation in granting the half-made request.
But the monotonous imploring became full of anguish,
and he finally took his daughter into his
councils and asked what ought to be done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denasia ought to be here,&rdquo; answered Ada. &ldquo;I
have her address. Let Davis go for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear! you do not understand that she
may&ndash;&ndash;that she is, perhaps, not what we should call a
good woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear father, who among us all is good? Even
Christ said, &lsquo;Why callest thou Me good? There is
none good save one, that is God.&rsquo; We know nothing
wrong of her with certainty. Why not give her the
benefit of the doubt? Are we not compelled to be
thus generous with all our acquaintances?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Denasia was sent for. She was sitting alone
in her comfortless room. The baby was gone away
for ever. Thinking of the lonely darkness of the
cemetery, with the cold earth piled high above the
little coffin, she felt a kind of satisfaction in her
own shivering solitude and silence. She was as far
as possible keeping with the little form a dreary
companionship. Yet she had been expecting Roland
and was greatly pained at his apparent neglect.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>When Davis knocked at the door she said drearily,
&ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; She thought it was her husband at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Mademoiselle Denasia?&rdquo; inquired a
strange voice.</p>
<p>A quick sense of trouble came to her; she stood
up and answered &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a gentleman at our house, Mr. Tresham;
he is very ill indeed. He asks for you constantly.
Mr. Lanhearne thinks you ought to come to him at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with a dreary patience and instantly
put on her cloak and hat. Not another word was
said. She asked no questions. She had reached
that point where women arrest all their feelings and
wait. The splendid house, the light, the warmth,
all the evidences of a luxurious life about, moved
her no more than if she was in a dream. A great
sorrow had put her far above these things. She
followed the servant who met her at the door without
conscious volition. A woman going to execution
could hardly have felt more indifference to the
mere accidentals of the way of sorrow. And when
a door was swung softly open, she saw no one in
the room but Roland. Roland helpless, unconscious.
Roland even then crying out &ldquo;Denasia!
Denasia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician, Mr. Lanhearne, and his daughter
stood by the fireside, and when Denasia entered
Ada went rapidly to her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are glad you have come,&rdquo; she said kindly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
&ldquo;You see how ill Mr. Tresham is. You are his
countrywoman&ndash;&ndash;his friend, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;am&ndash;&ndash;his&ndash;&ndash;wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said the words with a pathetic pride, and Ada
wondered why they hurt her so terribly. Like four
swords they pierced her heart and cut away from it
hope and happiness. She went back to her father&rsquo;s
side, and leaned her head on his shoulder, and felt
like one holding despair at bay. And oh, how
grateful to her was the secret silence of the night!
Then she wept as a little child weeps who has lost
its way. By her anguish and her sense of loss for
ever she was taught that Roland had become nearer
and dearer than she had ever suspected. And the
knowledge was a revelation of sorrow. Her delicate
conscience shivered in the shadow of a possible
wrong and the bitterness of the might-have-been
she was to fight without ceasing.</p>
<p>She felt no anger toward Denasia, however.
Denasia was only the hidden rock on which her
frail, unknown love-bark had struck and gone down.
And she was constrained to admit that, so far as
she herself was concerned, Roland was innocent.
She had, indeed, often felt hurt at his restraint and
want of response. In her pure, simple heart she had
called it pride, shyness, indifference; but she understood
now that this poor, weak soul had at least not
lacked honour.</p>
<p>So that there was in this apparently peaceful,
comfortable home two vital conflicts going on: the
struggle of a noble soul to slay love, the struggle
of unpitying death to slay life. About the ninth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
day Roland, though weak, had some favourable
symptoms, and there were good hopes of his recovery.
He talked with Denasia at intervals, and
assured of her forgiveness and love, slept peacefully
with his hand in his wife&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>A few days later, however, he appeared to be
much depressed. His dark, sunken eyes gazed wistfully
at Mr. Lanhearne, and he asked to be alone
with him for a little while. &ldquo;I am going to die,&rdquo;
he said, with a face full of vague, melancholy fear.
The look was so childlike, so like that of an infant
soul afraid of some perilous path, that Mr. Lanhearne
could not avoid weeping, though he answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear Roland. The doctor says that the
worst is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roland smiled with pleasure at the fatherly dropping
of the formal &ldquo;Mr.,&rdquo; but he reiterated the assertion
with a more decided manner. &ldquo;I am going to
die. Will you see that my wife goes back to
England to her father and mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will. Is there anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She knows all that is to be done. Comfort
her a little when I am dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Roland, we are going to Florida as
soon as you are able.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to a country much farther off. I
will tell you how I know. All my life long a figure
formless, veiled, and like a shadow has come to me
at any crisis. When I was striving for honours at
my college it whispered, &lsquo;you will not succeed.&rsquo;
When I went to my first business desk it brought
me the same message. The night before I sailed for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
America it stood at my bedside, and I heard the
one word, &lsquo;failure.&rsquo; This afternoon it told me, &lsquo;you
have come to the end of your life.&rsquo; Then my soul
said, &lsquo;Oh, my enemy, who art thou?&rsquo; And there
grew out of the dimness the likeness of a face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few moments there was a silence painful and
profound. Roland closed his eyes, and from under
their lids stole two large tears&ndash;&ndash;the last he would
ever shed. And Mr. Lanhearne was so awed and
troubled he could scarcely say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A face! Whose face, then, Roland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own! My own!&rdquo; and he spoke with that
patience of accepted doom which, while it carries
the warrant of death, has also death&rsquo;s resignation
and dignity.</p>
<p>After this revelation there was a decided relapse,
and after a few more days of suffering, of hope, and
despair had passed, the end came peacefully from
utter exhaustion. Mr. Lanhearne was present, but
it was into Denasia&rsquo;s eyes that Roland gazed until
this sad earth was lost to vision, and the dark, tearless
orbs, once so full of light and love, were fixed
and dull for evermore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all past! It is all over!&rdquo; cried Denasia,
&ldquo;all over, all over! Oh, Roland! Roland! My dear,
dear love!&rdquo; and Mr. Lanhearne led her fainting
with sorrow from the place of death.</p>
<p>And in another room, in a little sanctuary of holy
dreams and loving purposes, Ada knelt in a transport
of divine supplication, praying for the dying,
praying for the living, consecrating her own wounded
heart to the service of all women wearing for any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
reason the crown of sorrow, or drinking of the cup
of Gethsemane, or treading alone the painful road
which leads from Calvary to paradise. For herself
asking only with a sublime submission&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Roland Tresham</span> was buried beside his son,
and the friends and the places that had known
him knew him no more. There were only strangers
to lay him in the grave. His wife was too worn
out with watching and grief to leave her bed; his
sister was far away. Mr. Lanhearne and two or
three gentlemen whose acquaintance Roland had
made at the club of which Mr. Lanhearne was a
member paid the last pitiful rites, and then left him
alone for ever.</p>
<p>Ada sat with the sorrowful widow. Her innocent
heart was greatly troubled lest her interest in
Roland, though known only to herself, had been an
unintentional wrong. In every possible way she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
strove to atone for Roland&rsquo;s happiness in her home
and her own happiness in Roland&rsquo;s presence. When
she mentally contrasted these conditions with the
miserable conditions of the deserted wife and dying
child, she felt as if it would be impossible to balance
the unkind and unmerited difference. That she was
not specially drawn to Denasia only forced from
her a more generous concern for the unhappy woman.
And when death or sorrow tears from life the mask
of daily custom, then, without regard to the accidents
of birth, we behold ourselves, all alike sad seekers
among the shadows after light and peace.</p>
<p>And undoubtedly sympathy is like mercy; it
blesses those who give it as well as those who receive.
As Ada and Denas talked of the great mysteries
of life and death, their souls felt the thrill of
comradeship. Denas was usually reticent about her
own life, yet she opened her heart to Ada, and as
the two women sat together the day after the funeral,
the poor widow spent many hours in excusing the
dead and in blaming herself.</p>
<p>She spoke honestly of her vanity, of her desire to
get the better of Elizabeth by taking her brother
from her, of the satisfaction she felt in mortifying
the pride of the Burrells and the Treshams&ndash;&ndash;even
of her impatience and ill-temper with Roland because
he was not able to conquer the weaknesses
which were as natural to him as the blood in his
body or the thought in his brain; because he could
not alter the adverse circumstances which, as soon
as they touched American soil, began to close around
them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And my great grief is this,&rdquo; she cried, wringing
her long, wasted hands: &ldquo;he has died before his
time and he has gone so far away that he neither
sees my repentance nor hears my words of remorseful
sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you desire the dead to see your sorrow,
Mrs. Tresham?&rdquo; said Ada. &ldquo;Sorrow is for the living,
not for the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is not enough to be seen by the living!
I want the dead to know that I grieve! When I
have wept on my mother&rsquo;s breast and knelt at my
father&rsquo;s feet, I shall still long for poor Roland to
know that I am sorry for the cross looks and cross
words and all the petty discomforts which drove
him from me&ndash;&ndash;drove him to death before his time;
that is the cruellest thing of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lanhearne entered the room as she spoke,
and he sat down and answered her: &ldquo;To die before
one&rsquo;s time, before one has seen and heard, and
enjoyed and suffered the full measure of life, may
seem hard, Mrs. Tresham, but there is something in
this respect much harder. I have just been with a
man who has lived after his time. The grave has
swallowed up all his loves and all his joys, and he
alone is left of his family and friends. Over such
lingering lives thick, dark shadows fall, I can assure
you. They have the loneliness of the grave without
its quiet sleep and its freedom from unkindness and
suffering. Let me advise you, as soon as you can
bear the journey, to go to your own people. It was
your husband&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it was, sir. I have fought hunger and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
sorrow and death like a cat. But there is no need
to continue the fight. I will go to the good father
and mother that God gave me. I will weep no
more rebellious tears. I will surrender myself and
wait for His comfort. I am but a poor, suffering
woman, but I know the hand that has smitten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Ada bowed her head and repeated softly:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;They are most high who humblest at God&rsquo;s knees</p>
<p>Lie loving God, and trusting though He smite.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Then they spoke of the sea-journey, and Denas
wished to go away as soon as possible. &ldquo;I shall
get some money as soon as I arrive in London,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Lend me sufficient to pay my passage there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no occasion to borrow money, Mrs.
Tresham,&rdquo; said Mr. Lanhearne. &ldquo;There is a sum
due your husband which will be quite sufficient to
meet all your expenses home. I will send a man to
secure you a good berth. Shall it be for Saturday
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can go to-morrow very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you cannot go to-morrow, Mrs. Tresham,&rdquo;
answered Ada. &ldquo;You must have proper clothing to
travel in. If you will permit me, I will attend to
this matter for you at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though the proper clothing was a very prosaic
comfort, it was a tangible one to Denas. She was
grateful to find herself clothed in that modest, sombre
decency which her condition claimed; to have
all the small proprieties of the season and the circumstances,
all the toilet necessities which are part of
the expression of a refined nature. For the poor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
lady who pitifully lamented the calamity which had
&ldquo;reduced her to elegance&rdquo; indicated no slight deprivation;
proper clothing for the occasions of life
being both to men and women one of those great
decencies demanded by an austere and suitable self-respect.</p>
<p>Faithfully did this good father and daughter fulfil
to the last tittle the demands of their almost super-sensitive
hearts and consciences, and if they sighed
with relief when the duty was over, the sigh only
proved the duty to have been beyond the line of
self-satisfaction and a real sacrifice to the claims
of a common humanity. Mr. Lanhearne then turned
his thoughts gladly toward Florida. He felt that
the invasion of so much strange sorrow into his
home had altered its atmosphere, and that he was
human enough to be a little weary in well-doing.
Ada was also glad to escape the precincts haunted
by the form and the voice which it pained her conscience
to remember and pained her heart to forget.
So in a few more days the large brown house
was closed and dark, and &ldquo;the tender grace of a
day that was dead&rdquo; was gone for evermore. The
land of sunshine was before them, and many of their
friends were already there to give them welcome;
yet Ada&rsquo;s soul kept repeating, with a ceaseless, uncontrollable
monotony, one sad lament&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but alas! for the smile that never but one face wore!</p>
<p>Ah, for the voice that has flown away like a bird to an unknown shore!</p>
<p>Ah, for the face&ndash;&ndash;the flower of flowers&ndash;&ndash;that blossoms on earth no more!&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>She tried to hush this inner voice, to reason it
into silence, to dull its aching echo with song or
speech or notes of loftier tones; but it would not
be quieted. And when she was left alone, when
there was no one near to comfort or strengthen, a
great silence fell upon her. For she indulged no
stormy sorrow; her grief was a still rain that fertilised
and made fragrant her higher self. In her
maiden heart she had had a dream of being crowned
with bride-flowers, and lo! it was rue, and thyme
gone to seed, and dead primroses that garlanded her
sad, unspoken love. But she wore them with a
sweet, brave submission, not affecting to disbelieve
that time would surely heal love&rsquo;s aching pain. For
she knew that goodness was omnipotent to save and
to comfort.</p>
<p>In the mean time, as the Lanhearnes sailed southward
Denas sailed eastward, and in less than a
couple of weeks half the circumference of the world
was between the lives so strangely and sorrowfully
brought together. Denas landed in Liverpool early
in the morning, and without delay went to London.
She had business with Elizabeth, and she felt constrained
and restless until it should be accomplished.
She hesitated about going to the house in which she
had spent with Roland so many happy and sorrowful
days, but when she entered the cab the direction to
it sprang naturally from her lips.</p>
<p>And there was already in her heart that tender
fear that she might forget, the fear that all who
have loved and lost have trembled to recognise, the
fact that her sorrow might have an end, that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
might learn to dispense with what was once her
life, that a little vulgar existence with its stated
meals and regular duties and petty pleasures would
ever fill the void in her love and life made by
Roland&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>So she tried, in the very place of her sweet bride
memories, to bring back the first passion of her
widowed grief. She tried to fill the empty chair
with Roland&rsquo;s familiar form and the silent space
with his happy voice. Alas! other thoughts would
intrude; considerations about Elizabeth&rsquo;s attitude,
about her home, about her future. For she knew
that this part of her life was finished; that nothing
could ever bring back its conditions. They had
been absolutely barren conditions. Her duties as a
wife and a mother were over. Her career as a
singer was over. No single claim of friendship or
interest from its past bound her. When she had
seen Elizabeth these last years of her being and
doing would be a shut book. Nothing but her
change of name and, perhaps, a little money would
remain to testify that Denas Penelles had ever been
Denasia Tresham.</p>
<p>Do as she would, she could not keep these thoughts
apart from her memories of her lover and her husband.
She arrested her mind continually and bade
herself remember the days of her gay bridal, or else
those two lonely graves far beyond the western sea;
and then, ere she was aware, her memories of the
past had become speculations about the future. And
she was abashed by this arid, incurable egotism in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
the most secret place of her soul. She felt it making
itself known continually in her hard determination
to make the best of things; she knew that it
was this feeling which was determined to close the
death chamber, to deny all torturing memories; which
said, in effect, &ldquo;what is finished is finished, and the
dead are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the conflict wearied her almost to insensibility.
She was also physically exhausted by travel,
and the next day she slept profoundly until nearly
the noon hour. It had been her intention to see
Elizabeth in the morning, and she was provoked at
her own remissness, for what she feared in reality
happened&ndash;&ndash;Elizabeth was out driving when she
reached her residence. The porter thought it would
be six o&rsquo;clock ere she could receive any visitor,
&ldquo;business or no business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas said she would call at six o&rsquo;clock, and
charged the man to tell his mistress so.</p>
<p>But the visit and the engagement passed from the
servant&rsquo;s mind. In fact, he had, as he claimed, a
very genteel mind. Callers who came in a common
cab did not find an entry into it. Elizabeth returned
in due season from her drive, drank a cup of tea,
and then made her evening toilet. For Lord Sudleigh
was to dine with her, and Lord Sudleigh was
the most important person in Elizabeth&rsquo;s life. It
was her intention, as soon as she had paid the last
tittle of mint, anise, and cummin to Mr. Burrell&rsquo;s
memory, to become Lady Sudleigh. Everyone said
it was a most proper alliance, the proposed bride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
having money and beauty and the bridegroom-elect
birth, political influence, and quite as much love as
was necessary to such a matrimonial contract.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, however, in spite of her pleasant prospect
for the evening, was in a bad temper. The
bishop&rsquo;s wife had snubbed her in the drive, and her
dressmaker had disappointed her in a new costume.
The March wind also had reddened her face, and
perhaps she had a premonition of trouble, which she
did not care to investigate. When informed that
there was a lady waiting to see her on important
business, she simply elected to let her wait until
her toilet was finished. She had a conviction that
it was some officious patroness on a charity mission&ndash;&ndash;someone
who wanted money for the good of other
people. And as there are times when we all feel
the claims of charity to be an unwarrantable imposition,
so Elizabeth, blown-about, sun-browned,
snubbed, disappointed, and anxious about her lover,
was not, on this particular occasion, more to blame
for want of courtesy than many others have been.</p>
<p>Finally she descended to the drawing-room and
was ready to receive her visitor. There was a very
large mirror in the room, and pending her entrance
Elizabeth stood before it noticing the set and flow
of her black lace dress, its heliotrope ribbons, and
the sparkle of the hidden jets upon the bodice.
Some heliotrope blossoms were in her breast, and
her hands were covered with gloves of the same delicate
colour. Denas saw her thus; saw her reflection
in the glass before she turned to confront her.</p>
<p>For a moment Elizabeth was puzzled. The white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
face amid its sombre, heavy draperies had a familiarity
she strove to name, but could not. But as Denasia
came forward, some trick of head-carriage or
of walking revealed her personality, and Elizabeth
cried out in a kind of angry amazement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas! You here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am no more Denas to you than you are Elizabeth
to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mrs. Tresham! And pray where is
my brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead? dead? Impossible! And if so, it is
your fault, I know it is! I had a letter from him&ndash;&ndash;the
last letter&ndash;&ndash;he said he was coming to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was frightfully pale; she staggered to a sofa,
sat down, and covered her face with her gloved
hands. Denasia stood by a table watching her
emotion and half-doubting its genuineness. A
silence followed, so deep and long that Elizabeth
could not endure it. She stood up and looked at
Denasia, reproach and accusation in every tone and
attitude. &ldquo;Where did he die?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what did he die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of pneumonia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your fault, I am sure of it. Your fault
in some way. My poor Roland! He had left
you, I know that; and I hoped everything for his
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had come back to me. He loved me better
than ever. He died in my arms&ndash;&ndash;died adoring me.
His last work on earth was to give me this list of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
property, which I shall require you either to render
back or to buy from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth knew well what was wanted, and her
whole soul was in arms at the demand. Yet it was a
perfectly just one. By his father&rsquo;s will Roland
had been left certain pieces of valuable personal
property: family portraits and plate, two splendid
cabinets, old china, Chinese and Japanese carvings,
many fine paintings, antique chairs, etc., etc., the
whole being property which had either been long
in the Tresham family or endeared to it by special
causes, and therefore left personally to Roland as
the representative of the Treshams. At the break
up of the Tresham home after his father&rsquo;s death,
Roland had been glad to leave these treasures in
Elizabeth&rsquo;s care, nor in his wandering life had the
idea of claiming them ever come to him. As for
their sale, that would have been an indignity to his
ancestors below the contemplation of Roland.</p>
<p>Fortunately Mr. Tresham&rsquo;s lawyer had insisted
upon Mrs. Burrell giving Roland a list of the articles
left in her charge and an acknowledgment of
Roland&rsquo;s right to them. &ldquo;Life is so queer and has
so many queer turns,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that nothing can be
left to likelihoods. Mrs. Burrell is not likely to
die, but she may do so; and then there may be a new
Mrs. Burrell who may make trouble, and I can conceive
of many other complications which would render
nugatory the intentions of the late Mr. Tresham.
The property must, therefore, be set behind the bulwark
of the law.&rdquo; Elizabeth herself had acknowledged
this danger, and she had done all that was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
required of her in order to keep the Tresham family
treasures within the keeping of the Treshams.</p>
<p>She was now confronted with her own acknowledgment
and agreement, or at least with a copy of
it, and she was well aware that it would be the
greatest folly to deny the claim of Roland&rsquo;s wife.
But the idea of robbing her beautiful home for
Denasia was very bitter to her. She glanced around
the room and imagined the precious cabinets and
china, the curious carvings and fine paintings taken
away, and then the alternative, the money she would
have to pay to Denasia if she retained them, came
with equal force and clearness to her intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Tresham,&rdquo; she said in a conciliating voice,
&ldquo;these objects can be of no value to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland told me they were worth at least two
thousand pounds, perhaps more. There is a picture
of Turner&rsquo;s, which of&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about Turner? And can you
really entertain the thought of selling things so
precious to our family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland wished you to buy them. If you do not
value them sufficiently to do so, why should I keep
them? In my father&rsquo;s cottage they would be absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s cottage? You are laughing at
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too sorrowful a woman to laugh. A few
weeks ago, if I had had only one of these pictures I
would have sold it for a mouthful of bread&ndash;&ndash;for a
little coal to warm myself; oh, my God! for medicine
to save my child&rsquo;s life or to ease his passage
to the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I had forgotten the child. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By his father&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well and best, doubtless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not well and best. What do you know?
You have never been a mother. God never gave
you such sorrowful grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will return to the list, if you please. What
do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken to a man in Baker Street who
deals in such things. If you wish to buy them and
will pay their fair value I will sell them to you,
because Roland desired you to have them. If you
do not wish to buy them or will not pay a fair
price I will remove them to Baker Street. There
are others who will know their value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I advanced Roland a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave him it. You demanded and accepted
his thanks. The sums all told would not pay for the
use of the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do right, of course. Bring the man you
have spoken of to-morrow afternoon, and I also
will have here an expert of the same kind. I will
pay you whatever they decide is a proper sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will satisfy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry affairs have come to this point between
us. I tried to be kind to you. I think you have
been very ungrateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were kind only to yourself. You never
were a favourite in St. Penfer. Other ladies did
not often call upon you. In me you had a companionship
which you could control, you had
your sewing done for next to nothing, you had the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
news of the town brought to you. You played upon
my restless disposition, my love of fine clothing,
my ambition to be some one greater than Denas
Penelles, and as soon as good fortune came to you
and you had everything you desired, you found me a
bore, a claimant on your sense of justice which you
did not like to meet. Understand that the fact of
wearing silk and jewelry does not give you the
right to take up an immortal soul and play with it
or cast it aside as you find it convenient. I owe
you the deepest grudge. You made me dissatisfied
with my own life, you showed me the pleasant vistas
of a different life, and when I hoped to enter with
you, I found myself outside and the door shut in
my face. You have always tried to make Roland
dissatisfied with me. You insinuated, you deplored,
in every letter to him. You stabbed while you
pretended to kiss me. I found you out long ago.
Everyone finds you out. You never had a friend.
You never will have one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with that pitiless scorn which is the
language of suppressed passion. Elizabeth only
lifted her eyebrows and turned away from her.
And Denasia knew that she had made a mistake,
and yet she did not regret it. There are times when
it is a relief to be angry, whether we do well to be
so or not; when to lose the temper is better than to
keep it. Of course there are great and beautiful
souls with whom nothing turns to bitterness, but
the soul of Denasia was not one of these. It had
been born ready to feel and ready to speak, and
regarded it as something of a virtue to do so.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></div>
<p>She left Elizabeth&rsquo;s house in a very unhappy
mood, and at a rapid walk proceeded to her lodging
in Bloomsbury. She would have felt the confinement
of a cab to be intolerable, but it was a relief
to set her personality against the friction of a million
of encompassing wills. And in a short time
she succumbed to that condition of electricity which
they evolve, and permitted herself to be moved by
it without considering her steps.</p>
<p>At length she was hungry, and she turned into a
place of refreshment and ate with more healthy
desire than she had felt for many months, and then
the restless, fretting creature within was pacified,
and she resolved to walk quietly to her room and
sleep before she suffered herself to think any more.
But as she was following out this plan she came to
a famous theatre, and the name at the entrance
attracted her. &ldquo;I will be my own judge,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I will see, and hear, and be more unmerciful to
myself than any other could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she entered the place and sat throughout three
scenes. She did not wait for the final act. There
was no necessity. She had arrived at her verdict.
It was in her eyes and attitude when she left the
building, but she gave it no voice until she sat
weary and sad before the glimmering fire in her
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could be Queen of England as easily as I could
be a prima donna,&rdquo; she said mournfully. &ldquo;There
was perhaps a time&ndash;&ndash;perhaps&ndash;&ndash;perhaps, when youth
and beauty and love could have helped me, but that
time has gone for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></div>
<p>She said the words slowly, and the weight of
despair was on each one. For she realised that in
her case effort had brought forth no lasting fruit
and that endurance had been without avail, and she
was exceedingly sorrowful. For there is a singular
vitality in the idea of public singing or acting
when once it has taken root in any nature, and
Denasia had been subject that night to one of its
periods of revival. She had told herself that &ldquo;she
would probably have a thousand pounds; that she
could go to Italy and pay for the best teachers; that
it would please Roland if he knew, if he remembered,
for her to do so; that it would annoy Elizabeth
in many ways if she became a singer; that
she would show the world it was possible to sing
and act and yet be in every respect womanly, pure-hearted,
and blameless before God and man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These and many such ideas had filled her mind
at intervals all the way across the Atlantic, and her
passionate renunciation of the stage, made that miserable
day when Roland deserted her, began to lose
its reasonableness and therefore its sense of obligation.
After her interview with Elizabeth, the question
of money to carry out such intentions was practically
settled, and she had, therefore, only to arrive
at a positive personal conclusion. Once or twice
in her public career she had received what her heart
told her was a just criticism. It had not been a
very flattering one, and Roland had passionately
denied its justice. But she felt that the hour had
now come when she must have the truth and accept
the truth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></div>
<p>So she had tested herself by the natural and acquired
abilities of the greatest singer of the day.
It was, perhaps, a pitiless standard, but she felt that
her safety demanded its extremity. Her comparisons
made her burn with shame at her own shortcomings.
She wondered how Roland could have
been so deceived, how he could have hoped or believed
in her at all. She forgot that circumstances
had quite altered Roland&rsquo;s first intentions, and that
in following out his secondary ones less distinctive
talent was sufficient. On their marriage if he had
taken her, as he proposed, to Italy; if the three last
restless, miserable years had been spent in repose, in
a favourable climate under fine instructors, with a
happy, satisfied, hopeful affection to stimulate and
support her ambition&ndash;&ndash;ah, then all of Roland&rsquo;s
hopes might have been fulfilled. But lack of patience
as much as lack of money had brought final failure.
The blossom had been gathered and worn with but
small <i>&eacute;clat</i>, and there was now no hope of fruit.</p>
<p>Full of such sombre thoughts, she turned up the
lights and looked at herself. Gone was her radiant
beauty, her splendid youth; gone also her buoyant
spirit and invincible courage. That night as she
sat there alone she buried for ever this hope of a
life for which she was not destined. Yet it was
while sitting on that very hearth together Roland
and she had felt the joy of her first triumph at
Willis Hall. She could remember every incident
of her return home the night of her brilliant <i>d&eacute;but</i>.
How Roland had praised her and loved her. Neither
of them then thought the temporary success to be the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
first downward step from their original grander
ideal; the first step toward a miserable failure.
Now it was clear enough. Alas! alas! Why cannot
joy, as well as sorrow, open the eyes? Why
are they only washed clear-seeing with tears?</p>
<p>When the hopeless ceremony was over and she
had fully accepted the lot before her, she rose and
with tear-filled eyes looked around the place of her
renunciation. She felt as if her husband ought to
have some consciousness of her disappointment; as
if the longing in her heart should bring him to her
side. Where was he? Where had he gone to?
&ldquo;Roland! Roland!&rdquo; she whispered, and the silence
beat upon her heart like the blows of a hammer.
Was he present? Did he hear her? She felt until
she reached the very rim of conscious feeling, and
then? Alas! nothing but a mighty mystery looming
beyond.</p>
<p>Weary and exhausted with emotion, she lay down
and slept, and in the morning the courage born of
a resolved mind was with her. When she had finished
her business with Elizabeth, then there was her
father and her mother and her real life again. She
must go back and take it up just where she had
thrown it down. And this humiliating duty was all
that her own way had brought her. Never again
would she take her destiny out of the keeping of the
good God who orders all things well. On this
resolution she stayed her heart, and somehow in her
sleep there had come to her a conviction that the
time of smiles would surely come back to her once
more. For God giveth His children in their sleep,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
and the sorrowful wake up comforted, and the weak
strong, because some angel has visited them and
&ldquo;they knew it not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth was quite prepared for her visitor.
She was, indeed, anxious to get the affair settled and
to dismiss Denasia from her life for ever. Her lawyer
and appraiser were busy when Denasia arrived,
and without ceremony each article specified in
Roland&rsquo;s list was examined and valued. Elizabeth
offered her sister-in-law no courtesy; she barely
bowed in response to her greeting, and there was a
final very severe struggle as to values. Mrs. Burrell
had certainly hoped to satisfy Denasia with a thousand
pounds, but the official adjustment was sixteen
hundred pounds, and for this sum Roland&rsquo;s widow,
who was irritated by her sister-in-law&rsquo;s evident scorn
and dislike, stubbornly stood firm.</p>
<p>It is probable that Elizabeth would also have
turned stubborn and have suffered the articles to go
to the auction-room had not her personal pride and
interests demanded the sacrifice. But she had
already introduced Lord Sudleigh to these family
treasures, and she could not endure to go to Sudleigh
Castle and take with her no heirlooms to be surety
for her respectability. So that, after all, Denasia
won her rights easily, because a man whom she had
never seen and never even heard of pleaded her
case for her. But she had no exceptional favour.
It is the people whom we do not know that are often
our helpers. It is the people who seem to have no
possible connection with us that are often the tools
used by fate for our fortune.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>When the transaction was fully over and Denasia
had Elizabeth&rsquo;s cheque in her pocket the day was
nearly over. The business agents left hurriedly and
Denasia was going with them, when Elizabeth said:
&ldquo;Return a moment, if you please, Mrs. Tresham. I
have heard nothing from you about my brother. I
think it is your duty to give me some information.
I am very miserable,&rdquo; and she sat down and covered
her face. Her sobs, hardly restrained, touched
Denasia. She was sorry for the weeping woman,
for she knew that if Elizabeth had loved any human
creature truly and unselfishly, it was her brother
Roland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I tell you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to comfort me, if you are not utterly
heartless. Had he doctors? help? comforts of any
kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had everything that money and love could
procure. He died in Mr. Lanhearne&rsquo;s house. I
was at his side. Whatever could be done by human
skill to save his life was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he name me often?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never said a word&ndash;&ndash;never would have
done&ndash;&ndash;you were going away without telling me.
How could you be so cruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was wrong. I should have told you. He
spoke often about you. In his delirium he believed
himself with you. He called your name three
times just before he died; it was only a whisper
then, he was so weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth wept bitterly, and Denasia, moved by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
many memories, could not watch her unmoved.
After a wretched pause she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye! You are Roland&rsquo;s sister and he
loved you. So then I cannot really hate you.
I forgive you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Elizabeth did not answer. The loss of her
brother, the loss of her money&ndash;&ndash;she was feeling
that this woman had been the cause of all her sorrows.
Grief and anger swelled within her heart;
she felt it to be an intolerable wrong to be forgiven.
She was silent until Denasia was closing the door,
then she rose hastily and followed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and never cross my path
again. You have brought me nothing but misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite just that I should bring you misery.
Remember, now, that if you do a wrong you will
have to pay the price of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trembling with anger and emotion, she clasped
her purse tightly and called a cab to take her to
her lodging. The money was money, at any rate.
A poor exchange for love, certainly, but still Roland&rsquo;s
last gift to her. It proved that in his dying
hours he loved her best of all. He had put his
family pride beneath her feet. He had put his
sister&rsquo;s interest second to her interest. She felt
that every pound represented to her so much of
Roland&rsquo;s consideration and affection. It was, too,
a large sum of money. It made her in her own
station a very rich woman. If she put it in the St.
Penfer bank it would insure her a great deal of
respect. That was one side of the question. The
other was less satisfactory. People would speculate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
as to how she had become possessed of such a
sum. Many would not scruple to say, &ldquo;It was sinful
money, won in the devil&rsquo;s service.&rdquo; All who
wished to be unkind to her could find in it an occasion
for hard sayings. In small communities
everything but prosperity is forgiven; that is never
really forgiven to anyone; and though Denasia
did not find words for this feeling, she was aware
of it, because she was desirous to avoid unnecessary
ill-will.</p>
<p>She sat with the cheque in her hand a long time,
considering what to do with it. Her natural vanity
and pride, her sense of superior intelligence,
education, travel, and experience urged her to take
whatever good it might bring her. And she went
to sleep resolving to do so. But she awoke in the
midnight with a strange sense of humiliation. In
that time of questions she was troubled by soul-inquiries
that came one upon another close as the
blows of a lash. She was then shocked at the intentions
with which she had fallen asleep. The little
vanities, and condescensions, and generosities
which she had planned for her own glory&ndash;&ndash;how contemptible
they appeared! And in the darkness she
could see their certain end&ndash;&ndash;envy and hatred for
herself and dissatisfaction and loss of friends for
her father and mother. Had she not already given
them sorrow enough?</p>
<p>Her right course was then clear as a band of
light. She would deposit the money at interest in
a London bank. She would say nothing at all
about its possession. Before leaving for St. Penfer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
she would buy a couple of printed gowns, such
as would not be incongruous with her surroundings.
She would go back to her home and village as empty-handed
as she left them&ndash;&ndash;a beggar, even, for a little
love and sympathy, for toleration for her wanderings,
for forgiveness for those deeds by which she
had wounded the consciences and self-respect of her
own people and her own caste.</p>
<p>This determination awoke with her in the morning,
and she followed it out literally. The presents
she had resolved to buy in order to get herself a
little favour were put out of consideration. She purchased
only a few plain garments for her own every-day
wearing. She left her money with strangers
who attached no importance to it; and, with one
small American trunk holding easily all her possessions,
she turned her face once more to the little
fishing village of St. Penfer by the Sea.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Only</span> those who have experienced the sensation
can tell how strange and sad is the feeling
with which the soul turns away from a destiny accomplished.
When Denas had deposited her money in
the Clydesdale Bank and made the few purchases
she thought proper and prudent, she felt that one
room of the house of life was barred for ever against
her return to it.</p>
<p>For a few years her experiences had been strangely
interwoven with those of the Treshams. To what
purpose? Why had they been so? As far as this
existence was concerned, it seemed a relationship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
that might well have been omitted. But who can
tell what circumstances went before it or what were
to follow? For all human beings leave behind them
as they go through life a train of events which are
due either to impulses originating in a previous existence
or are the seeds of events which are to be perfected
in a future one; what we sow, that we shall
surely reap.</p>
<p>Leaving London, such thoughts of something
final, at least as far as this probation was concerned,
greatly depressed Denas. &ldquo;Never more, never
more,&rdquo; was the monotonous refrain that sprang from
her soul to her lips. But it is a wise provision of the
Merciful One that the past, in a healthy mind, very
soon loses its charm, and the things that are present
take the first place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot bring anything back. I do not think
I would bring anything back if I could. I have
been very unhappy and restless in the past. Every
pleasure I had was tithed by sorrow. Roland loved
me, but I brought him only disappointment. I loved
Roland, and yet all my efforts to make him happy
were failures. Roland has been taken from me.
Our child has been taken away from me. Elizabeth
I have put away&ndash;&ndash;death could not sever us more
effectually. I am going back to my own people and
my own life, and I pray God to give me a contented
heart in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the colour of her reflections as the
train bore her swiftly to the fortune of her future
years. She had no enthusiasm about them. She
thought she knew all the possibilities they kept.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
She looked for no extraordinary thing, for no special
favour to brighten their uniform <a name='TC_8'></a><ins title="Was 'ocupations'">occupations</ins> and
simple pleasures. She had taken the first train
she could, without considering the time of its arrival
in St. Penfer. She told herself that there
would be a certain amount of gossip about her return,
and that it could not be avoided by either a
public or private arrival. Still, she was glad when
the sun set and the shadows of the night were
stretched out&ndash;&ndash;glad that the moon was too young to
give much light, and that it was quite nine o&rsquo;clock
when the St. Penfer station was reached.</p>
<p>A few people were on the platform, but none of
them were thinking of Mrs. Tresham, and the woman
so simply dressed and veiled in black made no impression
on anyone. She left her trunk in the baggage-room
and went by the familiar road down the
cliff-breast. It had been raining, of course, and
the ground was heavy and wet; but the sky was
clear, and the half-moon made a half-twilight among
the bare branches and shed a faint bar of light
across the ocean.</p>
<p>At the last reach she stood still a moment and
looked at the clustered cottages and the boats swaying
softly on the incoming tide. A great peace
was over the place. The very houses seemed to be
resting. There was fire or candle light in every
glimmering square of their windows; but not a man,
or a woman, or a child in sight. As she drew near
to her father&rsquo;s cottage, she saw that it was very
brightly lighted; and then she remembered that it
was Friday night, and that very likely the weekly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
religious meeting was being held there. That would
account for the diffused quiet of the whole village.</p>
<p>The thought made her pause. She had no desire
to turn her home-coming into a scene. So she
walked softly to the back of the little house and
entered the curing shed. There was only a slight
door&ndash;&ndash;a door very seldom tightly closed&ndash;&ndash;between
this shed and the cottage room. She knew all its
arrangements. It was called a curing shed, but in
reality it had long been appropriated to domestic
purposes. Joan kept her milk and provisions in it,
and used it as a kind of kitchen. Every shelf and
stool, almost every plate and basin, had its place
there, and Denas knew them. She went to the milk
pitcher and drank a deep draught; and then she
took a little three-legged stool, and placing it gently
by the door, sat down to listen and to wait.</p>
<p>Her father was talking in that soft, chanting tone
used by the fishers of St. Penfer, and the drawling
intonations, with the occasional rise of the voice at
the end of a sentence, came to the ears of Denas with
the pleasant familiarity of an old song.</p>
<p>As he ceased speaking some woman began to sing
&ldquo;The Ninety-and-Nine,&rdquo; and so singing they rose
and passed out of the cottage and to their own
homes. One by one the echoes of their voices
ceased, until, at the last verse, only John and Joan
were singing. As they finished, Denas looked into
the room. Joan was lifting the big Bible covered
with green baize. Between this cover and the binding
all the letters Denas had sent them were kept,
and the fond mother was touching and straightening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
them. John, with his pipe in one hand, was lifting
the other to the shelf above his head for his tobacco-jar.
The last words of the hymn were still on
their lips.</p>
<p>Denas opened the door and stood just within the
room, looking at them. Both fixed their eyes upon
her. They thought they saw a spirit. They were
speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! Mother! It is Denas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came forward quickly as she spoke. Joan
uttered one piercing cry. John let his pipe fall to
pieces on the hearthstone and drew his child within
his arms. &ldquo;It be Denas! It be Denas! her own
dear self,&rdquo; he said, and he sat down and took her to
his breast, and the poor girl snuggled her head into
his big beard, and he kissed away her tears and
soothed her as he had done when she was only a
baby.</p>
<p>And then poor Joan was on the rug at their feet.
She was taking the wet stockings and shoes off of
her daughter&rsquo;s feet; she was drying them gently
with her apron, fondling and kissing them as she
had been used to do when her little Denas came in
from the boats or the school wet-footed. And
Denas was stooping to her mother and kissing the
happy tears off her face, and the conversation was
only in those single words that are too sweet to
mix with other words; until Joan, with that womanly
instinct that never fails in such extremities,
began to bring into the excited tone those tender
material cares that make love possible and life-like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my darling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;your little feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
be dripping wet, and you be hungry, I know, and
we will have a cup of tea. And, Denas, there be such
a pie in the cupboard. And a bowl of clotted cream,
too. It is just like the good God knew my girl was
coming home. And I wonder who put it into my
heart to have a mother&rsquo;s welcome for her? And how
be your husband, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s peace on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the little lad, Denas&ndash;&ndash;my little grandson
that be called John after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead, too, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they were speechless, and they kissed her
again and mingled their tears with her tears, and
John felt a sudden lonely place where he had put
this poor little grandson whom he was never to see.</p>
<p>Then Denas began to drink her warm tea and to
talk to her parents; but they said no words but kind
words of the dead. They listened to the pitiful taking-away
of the young man, and before the majesty
of death they forgot their anger and their dislike,
and left him hopefully to the mercy of the Merciful.
For if John and Joan knew anything, they knew that
none of us shall enter paradise except God cover us
with His mercy.</p>
<p>And not one word of all her trouble did Denas
titter. She spoke only of Roland&rsquo;s great love for
her; of their trials endured together; of his resignation
to death; of her own loneliness and suffering
since his burial; and then, clasping her father&rsquo;s and
mother&rsquo;s hands, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I have come back to you. I have come back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
to my old life. I shall never act again. I shall
sing no more in this world. That life is over. It
was not a happy life. Without Roland it would be
beyond my power to endure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You be welcome here as the sunshine. Oh, my
dear girl, you be light to my eyes and joy to my
heart, and there is no trouble can hurt me much
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joan said: &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas this very morning I put
clean linen on your bed, Denas. I swept the room,
and then made the pie, and clotted the cream, and
I never knew who I did it for. Oh, Denas, what a
godsend you do be! John, my old dear, our life
be turned to sunshine now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And long after Denas had fallen asleep they sat
by their fire and talked of their child&rsquo;s sorrow, and
Joan got up frequently and took a candle and, shading
it with her hand, went and looked to see if the
girl was all right. When Denas was a babe in the
cradle, Joan had been used to satisfy her motherly
longing in the same way. Her widowed child was
still her baby.</p>
<p>In the morning John went from cottage to cottage
and told his friends to come and rejoice with him.
For really to John &ldquo;the dead was alive and the lost
was found.&rdquo; And it was a great wonderment in the
village; men nor women could talk of anything else
but the return of Denas Tresham. Many were really
glad to see her; and if some visited the poor, stricken
woman thinking to add a homily to God&rsquo;s smiting,
they were abashed by her evident suffering, by her
pallor and her wasted form, and the sombre plainness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
of her black garments. For some days life was
thus kept at a tension beyond its natural strain, and
Joan and her daughter had no time to recover the
every-day atmosphere. But no excitement outlasts
the week&rsquo;s perchances and changes, and after the
second Sunday all her acquaintances had seen Denas,
and curiosity and interest were at their normal
standard.</p>
<p>All her acquaintances but Tris Penrose. Denas
wondered that he did not come to see her, and yet
she had a shy dislike to make inquiries about him.
For the love of Tris Penrose for Denas Penelles
had been the village romance ever since they were
children together, and she feared that a word from
her about him might set the women to smiling and
sympathising and to taking her affairs out of her
own hands.</p>
<p>As the home-life settled to its usual colour and
cares, Denas became conscious of a change in it.
She saw that her father went very seldom to sea,
that he was depressed and restless, and that her
mother, in a great measure, echoed his moods. And
she was obliged to confess that she was terribly
weary. There was little housework to do, except
what fell naturally to Joan&rsquo;s care, and interference
with these duties appeared to annoy the methodical
old woman. The knitting was far ahead, there
were no nets to mend; and when Denas had made
herself a couple of dresses, there seemed to be no
work for her to do. And she was not specially fond
of reading. Culture and study she could understand
if their definite end was money; but for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
simple love of information or pleasure books were
not attractive to her.</p>
<p>So in a month she had come to a place in her experience
when it was a consolation to think of that
sixteen hundred pounds in London. She might yet
find it necessary to her happiness; for without some
change she could not much longer endure the idleness
and monotony of her life. Fortunately the
change came. One morning a woman visited the
cottage, and the sole burden of her conversation
was the lack of a school in St. Penfer by the Sea to
which the fisher-children might go in the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here be my six little uns,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and up
the cliff they must hurry all, through any wind or
weather, or learn nothing. And then they be that
tired when they do get home again, they be no use
at all about the bait-boxes or the boats. There be
sixty school-going children in the village, and I do
say there ought to be a school here for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And suddenly it came into the heart of Denas to
open a school. Pay or no pay, she was sure she
would enjoy the work, and that afternoon she went
about it. An empty cottage was secured, a fisher-carpenter
agreed to make the benches, and at an
outlay of two or three pounds she provided all that
was necessary. The affair made a great stir in the
hamlet. She had more applications for admission
than the cottage would hold, and she selected from
these thirty of the youngest of the children.</p>
<p>For the first time in many months Denas was sensible
of enthusiasm in her employment. But Joan
did not apparently share her hopes or her pleasure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
She was silent and depressed and answered Denas
with a slight air of injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have agreed to pay a penny a week for
each child,&rdquo; Denas said to her mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Denas, some will pay and some will never
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. I know that, mother. But it does
not much matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, it do matter, my girl&ndash;&ndash;it do matter, a
great deal.&rdquo; And Joan began to cry a little and to
arrange her crockery with far more noise than was
necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mother, what is it? Are you in trouble of
any kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, Denas, I be troubled to think you
never saw your father&rsquo;s trouble. He be sad and
anxious enough, God knows. And no one to say
&lsquo;here, John,&rsquo; or &lsquo;there, John,&rsquo; or give him a helping
hand in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, mother, and tell me all. I have seen
that father&rsquo;s ways are changed and that he seldom
goes to the fishing. I hoped the reason was that he
had no longer any need to go regularly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need? Aw, my dear, he has no boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No boat! Mother, what do you mean to tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, child, that on the same night the steamer
<i>Lorne</i> was wrecked your father lost his boat and
his nets, and barely got to land with his life&ndash;&ndash;never
would have done that but for Tris Penrose, who lost
all, too&ndash;&ndash;and both of them at the mercy of the waves
when the life-boat reached them. Aw, my dear, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
bad night. And bad times ever since for your
father. Now and then he do get a night with
Trenager, or Penlow, or Adam Oliver; but they be
only making a job for him. And when pilchard
time comes, &rsquo;tis to St. Ives he must go and hire
himself out&ndash;&ndash;at his age, too. It makes me ugly,
Denas. My old dear hiring himself out after he
have sailed his own boat ever since man he was.
And then to see you spending pounds and pounds
on school-benches and books, and talking of it not
mattering if you was paid or not paid; and me
weighing every penny-piece, and your father counting
the pipefuls in his tobacco-jar. Aw, &rsquo;tis cruel
hard! Cruel! cruel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, mother, dry your eyes&ndash;&ndash;and there&ndash;&ndash;let
me kiss them dry. Listen: Father shall have
the finest fishing-boat that sails out of any Cornish
port. Oh, mother, dear! Spend every penny you
want to spend, and I will go to the church town this
afternoon to buy father tobacco for a whole year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me cry! Let me cry for joy, Denas! Let
me cry for joy! You have rolled a stone off my
heart. Be you rich, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not rich, mother, but I have sixteen hundred
pounds at interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sixteen hundred silent pounds, and they might
have been busy, happy, working pounds! Aw,
Denas, what hours of black care the knowing of
them might have saved us. But there, then&ndash;&ndash;I had
forgotten. The money be dance money and theatre
money, and your father will not touch a penny of it.
I do know he will not.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, when I stopped singing&ndash;&ndash;when I left
the theatre for ever I had not in my purse one half-penny.
Roland gave me fifty dollars; that came
from Elizabeth&ndash;&ndash;that was all I had. When it was
gone, Roland was employed by Mr. Lanhearne. I
told you about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. How then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roland&rsquo;s father left him pictures and silver
plate and many valuable things belonging to the
Treshams, and when Roland died they were mine.
Elizabeth bought them from me. They were worth
two thousand pounds; she gave me sixteen hundred
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell father and me? &rsquo;Twas cruel
thoughtless of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! I wanted to come back to you as I left
you&ndash;&ndash;just Denas&ndash;&ndash;without anything but your love
to ask favour from. If I had come swelling myself
like a great lady, worth sixteen hundred pounds,
how all the people would have hated me! What
dreadful things they would have said! Father would
have had his hands full and his heart full to make
this one and that one keep the insult behind their
lips. Oh, &rsquo;twould have been a broad defiance to
evil of every kind. I did think, too, that father had
some money in St. Merryn&rsquo;s Bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. And so he did. But there&ndash;&ndash;your
aunt Helen&rsquo;s husband was drowned last winter, and
nothing laid by to bury him, and father had it to
do; and then there was a mortgage on the cottage,
and that was to lift, or no roof to cover Helen and
her children. So with this and that the one hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
pounds went away to forty pounds. That be
for our own burying. There be twenty pounds of
yours there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is yours!&rdquo; Then rising quickly, she struck
her hands sharply together and cried out: &ldquo;<span class='smcap'>One</span>
and <span class='smcap'>All</span>! <span class='smcap'>One</span> and <span class='smcap'>All</span>!&rdquo;<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p>And Joan answered her promptly, letting the towel
fall from her grasp to imitate the sharp smiting of
the hands as with beaming face she repeated the
heart-stirring cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>One</span> and <span class='smcap'>All</span>! <span class='smcap'>One</span> and <span class='smcap'>All</span>! Denas. Aw, my
girl, there was a time when I said in my anger I
was sorry I gave you suck. This day I be right
glad of it! You be true blood! Cornish clean
through, Denas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I be true Cornish, mother, and the money
I have is honest money. Father can take it without
a doubt. But I will see Lawyer Tremaine, and he
shall put the sum I got in the St. Penfer <i>News</i>, and
tell what I got it for, and none can say I did wrong
to take my widow right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I be so happy, Denas! I be so happy! My old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
dear will have his own boat! My old dear will
have his own boat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, mother, neither you nor I can buy a boat.
Shall we tell father and let him choose for himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan knew this was the most prudent plan, but
that love of &ldquo;surprise pleasures&rdquo; which is a dominant
passion in children and uneducated natures
would not let Joan admit at once this solution of
the difficulty. How could she forego the delight of
all the private consultations; of the bringing home
of the boat; of the wonder of the villagers; of
John&rsquo;s happy amazement? She could not bear to
contemplate the prosaic, commonplace method of
sending John to buy his own boat when it was
within the power of Denas and herself to be an unseen
gracious providence to him. So after a moment&rsquo;s
thought she said: &ldquo;There be Tris Penrose.
It will be busy all and happy all for him to be
about such a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen Tris since I came home. He
is the only one who has not come to say welcome to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, &rsquo;twas only yesterday he got home himself.
He has been away with Mr. Arundel on his
yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked. I thought, then, you didn&rsquo;t
want Tris to be named.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what for shouldn&rsquo;t I name Tris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;La! my dear, the love in Tris&rsquo; heart was a
trouble to you. You were <a name='TC_9'></a><ins title="Was 'sayng'">saying</ins> that often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Tris knows about fishing-boats?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what kind of a boat father would like best?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None can tell that as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tris is home again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be true. Ann Trewillow told me, and she
be working at the Abbey two days in the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Mr. Arundel bought the Abbey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has done that, and it be made a grand place
now. And when Tris lost his boat trying to save
your father&rsquo;s life and boat, Mr. Arundel was with
the coast-guard and saw him. And he said: &lsquo;A
fine young man! A fine young man!&rsquo; So the next
thing was, he spoke to Tris and hired him to sail
his yacht. And &rsquo;tis far off, by the way of Giberaltar,
they have been&ndash;&ndash;yet home at last, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tris will be sure to come here, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ann Trewillow told him you were home&ndash;&ndash;a
widow, and all; he will be here as soon as he can
leave the yacht. It is here he comes first of all as
soon as he touches land again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will speak to him about the boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. And I do wish he would hurry
all and show himself. New boats be building, but
the best may get sold&ndash;&ndash;a day might make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, mother, you must try and lift the care
from father&rsquo;s heart. Let him know, some way, that
money troubles are over and that he may carry his
head up. You can do it&ndash;&ndash;a little word&ndash;&ndash;a little look
from you&ndash;&ndash;he will understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, Denas, a smile is enough. I can lift
my eyelids, and he&rsquo;ll see the light under them and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
catch it in his heart. John isn&rsquo;t a woman. Thank
God, he can be happy and ask no questions&ndash;&ndash;trusting
all. Your father be a good man to trust and
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the day, that had seemed to stretch itself
out so long and wearily, was all too short for Joan
and Denas. They talked about the money freely and
happily, and Denas could now tell her mother all the
circumstances of her visit to Elizabeth. They were
full of interest to the simple woman. She enjoyed
hearing about the dress Elizabeth wore; about her
house, her anger, her disappointment, and hard reluctance
to pay money for the treasures she had begun
to regard as her own.</p>
<p>So the morning passed quickly away, and in the
afternoon Denas went into the village to look after
her school-room. It was such a lovely spring day.
The sky was so blue, the sea was so blue, the earth
was so green and sweet, and the air so fresh and
clear that Denas could not but be glad that she
was alive to be cheered by them. Not for a very
long time had she felt so calmly happy, so hopeful
of the future, so resigned to the past.</p>
<p>After her business in the village was over she
walked toward the cliff. She had some idea that it
would be pleasant to go up to the church town, but
just where the trees and underwood came near to the
shingle a little bird singing on a May-thorn beguiled
her to listen. Then the songster went on
and on, as if it called her, and Denas followed its
music; until, by and by, she came to where the
shingle was but a narrow strip, and the verdure retreated,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
and the rocks grew larger and higher; and,
anon, she was at the promontory between St. Penfer
and St. Clair.</p>
<p>It would now be impossible to go up the cliff
and back again before tea-time, and she sat down
to rest a little before returning home. She sat
longer than she intended, for the dreamy, monotonous
murmur of the waves and the stillness and solitude
predisposed her to that kind of drifting thought
which keeps assuring time: &ldquo;I am going directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was effectually roused at last by the sound of
a clear, strong voice whistling a charming melody.
She sat quite still. A conviction that it was Tris
Penrose came into her heart. She wondered if he
would notice&ndash;&ndash;know&ndash;&ndash;speak to her. Tris saw her
figure as quickly as it came within his vision, and as
quickly as he saw it he knew who was present. He
ceased whistling and cried out cheerily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Denas? What, Denas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood up then and held out her hands to him.
And she was startled beyond measure by the Tris
that met her gaze. Naturally a very handsome man,
his beauty was made most attractive by a sailor suit
of blue broadcloth. His throat was open to the sea
breeze, a blue kerchief tied around it in a sailor&rsquo;s
knot. And then her eyes wandered to his sun-browned
face, close-curling black hair, and the little
blue, gold-trimmed cap set upon the curls. The
whole filled her with a pleasant wonder. She made
a little time over his splendour, and asked if he was
going to the pilchard fishing in such finery. And
he took all her hurried, laughing, fluttering remarks
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
with the greatest good-humour. He said, indeed,
that he had been told she was home again, and that
he wore the dress because he was coming to see her.</p>
<p>Then they sat down, and she told Tris what
she desired to do for her father, and Tris entered
into the project as enthusiastically as if he was a
child. Never before had Tris felt so heart-satisfied.
It was such a joy to have Denas beside him; such
a joy to know that she was free again; such a joy
to share a secret with her. And gradually the
effusiveness of their first meeting toned itself down
to quiet, restful confidence, and then they rose together
and began to walk slowly toward the cottage.
For of course Joan was to be consulted, and besides,
Tris had a present for her in his pocket.</p>
<p>The westering sun sent level rays of sunshine before
them, and they tried involuntarily to step in
it as they used to do when they were children.
Tris could not help a smile as they did so, and then
one of those closely personal conversations began
whose initial point is always: &ldquo;And do you remember?&rdquo;
Tris remembered everything, and especially
one Saturday when they ran away together to a little
fairy cove and made boats all day long. Yes,
every movement of that happy day was in Tris&rsquo;
heart, and he told Denas that the same pebbly shore
was still there, and that often he fancied he heard
on it the beat of their little pattering, naked feet,
and wished that they could have been children upon
the shore for ever, and ever, and evermore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that would have been nice at all,
Tris,&rdquo; answered Denas. &ldquo;It is better to be grown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
up. You were only good to play with then. I could
not have asked you to go and buy a boat for
father, could I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Tris looked at her sweet, pale face, and noting
how the pink colour rushed into her cheeks to
answer his looks, thought how right she was, and
that it was much better to have Denas a woman to
be loved than a child to be played with.</p>
<p>And somehow, after this, they had no more words
to say, and Tris walked at her side under his old
embarrassment of silence. Nor could Denas talk.
If she tried to do so, then she raised her eyes, and
then Tris&rsquo; eyes looking into hers seemed to reproach
her for the words she did not say. And if
she kept her eyes on the shingle, she still felt Tris
to be looking at her, questioning her, loving her
just as he used to do&ndash;&ndash;and she could not bear it&ndash;&ndash;never!
never! At the first opportunity she must
make Tris understand that they could only be
friends&ndash;&ndash;friends only&ndash;&ndash;and nothing, positively nothing
more.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">Money</span> in the bank is all the comfort to the
material life that a good conscience is to the
moral life. Joan was restored to her best self by the
confidence her child had given her, and John entering
his cottage in the midst of a happy discussion
between Denas, Tris, and his wife, felt as if the
weight of twenty years suddenly dropped away from
him. He thought it was Tris who brought the sunshine,
and he rejoiced in it, and induced the young
man to tell them about the yacht&rsquo;s trip and the old
cities on the Mediterranean which he had visited.</p>
<p>Everyone sees strange places with their own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
mental and spiritual sight, and Tris had seen
Genoa and Venice and Rome and Corinth from the
standpoint of a Cornish Methodist fisherman. But
apart from this partiality he had made sensible observations
of the strange ways of building and living,
and had come to the conviction that Cornish
people held the great secret of a happy life. As
for the Mediterranean itself, Tris considered it &ldquo;a
jade of a sea, nohow worth the praise it got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may read the Cornish seas like a book,
John,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but this Mediterranean be this
way&ndash;&ndash;you have to watch it every minute. Turn
your back on it for a bite or a sup, and it will get
the better of you some way, and, most likely of all,
with one of its dirty white squalls. Then I tell
you, John, it is all hands to reef! Quick! and if a
single breadth of canvas be showing, it is a rip and a
roar and the death of the yacht and of every man
in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the yacht herself, Tris? Be she
good-tempered and good-mannered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She do behave herself beautiful. The seas may
fly over her cross-trees, but if you make her trig
she comes to her bearings like a shot to its mark;
shakes herself as if she was ready for a race, and
then away she do go&ndash;&ndash;just like a sea-gull for a fish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they talked the evening away, and Denas listened
and watched the handsome yachtsman, kindling
and laughing to the tales he told. And when he
went away she felt, as others did, the sudden fall in
the mental temperature and the chill and silence
that follow any unnatural excitement. But Denas,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
as well as John and Joan, were too simple for such
considerations. They only felt the change, and
were sure that it was Tris who brought the sunshine,
and so, when he went, took it away with him.</p>
<p>But after this night there was a different atmosphere
in John Penelles&rsquo; cottage. John&rsquo;s unhappiness
had been mainly caused by the sight of his
wife&rsquo;s anxiety and sorrow; and if Joan was her old
self, John was not the man to let the loss of his boat
and his position make him miserable. For in this
little cottage the wife held the same mighty power
that the wife holds in all finer homes&ndash;&ndash;the power to
either make her husband weak and sorrowful or to
strengthen his heart for anything. When Joan
smiled, then John could not only enjoy the present,
but he could also bravely face the future. For when
a man can trust in his wife, then he can hope in his
God and all things are possible to him.</p>
<p>Denas also caught the trick of hoping and of being
happy. She opened her school with thirty
scholars and found out her vocation. No one
could doubt the voice which had called her to this
work; she went to it as naturally as a bird goes to
build its nest. She loved the children and they
loved her. At the end of the first week she found
herself compelled to make her number forty. The
sweet authority pleased her. The children&rsquo;s affection
won her. Her natural power to impart what
knowledge she had gave her the sense of a benefaction.
Such loving allegiance! Such bigoted
little adherents! Such blind disciples as Denas
had! In a couple of weeks she was the idol of every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
child in St. Penfer by the Sea, and as mothers see
through their children, she was equally popular with
the children of larger growth.</p>
<p>One very singular incident of this popularity was
the fact that every child, without special intent,
without the slightest thought of offence, called their
beloved teacher Denas Penelles. For a time she
corrected the mistake, but the name Tresham was
strange and unfamiliar. They looked at her with
wide-open eyes and then went back to the old word.
Denas perceived that they heard her called Penelles
in their homes, and that it was useless to take
offence where none was intended. Yet the inferred
wrong to her dead husband wounded her
and rekindled in her heart the fire of old affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They want me to forget his very name,&rdquo; she
thought angrily, and the natural result was a determination
to nurse with greater fondness the memory
which time and circumstances were daily doing their
best to efface.</p>
<p>In the mean time all had been going on satisfactorily
about the new fishing-smack. Tris had taken
Mr. Arundel into his confidence. He wished to have
his permission to make a careful selection and to
attend to all matters connected with its proper transfer.
And though that gentleman&rsquo;s own feelings did
not lie upon the surface of his nature or explain
themselves in childlike secrets and surprises, he
could understand and almost envy the wealth of
emotions and illusions that demanded such primitive
expressions.</p>
<p>So he permitted Tris to absent himself frequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
for such a laudable purpose. Indeed, Mr. Arundel
had seen the death of John&rsquo;s boat, and this point
of interest enabled him to feel something of the
pleasure and importance which centred around the
boat now building to take its place. For Tris had
found in a yard ten miles north just the very
kind of smack John had always longed for&ndash;&ndash;a boat
not built by mathematical measurements, but a wonderful,
weatherly, flattish smack; that with a jump
would burst through a sea any size you like, and
keep right side up when the waves were fit to make
a mouthful of her.</p>
<p>She was building for the pilchard season and was
to be ready for the middle of June. And at length
she was finished and waiting to be brought to her
own harbour. If she had been a living, loving human
creature, her advent could not have been more
eagerly longed for. Yet there had been a short
period of coolness between Tris and Denas, for Tris
in some moment of enthusiasm had gone beyond the
line Denas had marked out for him. And then she
had been cold and silent and Tris had been miserable.
Joan, also, had taken the young man rather
scornfully to task.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tris,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you be as knowing about a
woman as Peter Mullet was, and he was hanged for
a fool. Be you looking to sow and reap in the same
month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I know by, but&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you be so blind in love you could not see
a hole in a ladder or tell the signs on a woman&rsquo;s
face. Denas be &rsquo;fraid of her own self. Let her be.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
Let her be. If you do say a word now about your
love she will run back and hide herself in an old
love&ndash;&ndash;that be a woman&rsquo;s way. See, now! As the
old love quails the new love will fetch up&ndash;&ndash;but
time given for quailing, Tris, for all that. Denas
had a sight of trouble, Tris; she may well be feared
to try matrimony again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would try and make her happy. I would be
a good husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Husbands! husbands! Tris, they be like pilchards&ndash;&ndash;the
bad ones are very bad and the best
ones be but middling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the loving fellow said with a big sigh that
he would wait&ndash;&ndash;but tired of waiting and going
away again, and back only when God and Mr. Arundel
said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then,&rdquo; answered Joan, &ldquo;a good thing.
Women have to miss a man before they know they
love him. Give Denas time to miss you, Tris, and
when the boat is home be a bit careless like. If she
do wonder and worry a little&ndash;&ndash;a good thing for her.
Women they be made up of contraries, but sweet
as blossoms and as good as gold for all that, Tris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the twenty-fourth all was ready to bring home
the boat. The boat had been sold to Denas Tresham,
the money paid, and the deed of transfer to
John Penelles ready made out. There had also
been prepared a paper for the St. Penfer <i>News</i>,
which was to appear that day, and which Lawyer
Tremaine said would supply a ten-days&rsquo; holiday
gossip for the citizens. And no day specially made
for so happy an event could have been lovelier.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
The sea was dimpling all over in the sunshine;
there was just the right wind, and just enough of it,
to let Tris reach harbour in the afternoon. John
wondered at the air of excitement in his cottage.
Joan was singing, Denas had her best dress on, and
both had been busy making clotted cream, and
junket, and pies of all kinds.</p>
<p>In fact, John was a little depressed by this extravagance
of light hearts. He did not think the
money Denas got from her school warranted it, and
he was heart-sick with the terrible fear that the
busy season was at hand and that he had found
nothing to do. Adam Oliver&rsquo;s two nephews from
Cardiff had come to help him, and that shut one
place; and neither Trenager nor Penlow had said a
word to him, and his brave old soul sank within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what be in the wind with you women I
know nothing of,&rdquo; he said fretfully, &ldquo;but you do
have some unlikely old ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What way be the wind, John, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little nor&rsquo;ard, what there be of it&ndash;&ndash;only a
capful, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, John, look to the nor&rsquo;ard, for good
luck do come the way the wind blows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck do come the way God sends it, Joan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And many a time and oft it do be coming and
us not thinking of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John nodded gravely. There was little hope in
his heart, but he went as usual to the pier and
stood there watching the boats. Most of them were
now ready for the fishing. When the men on the
lookout saw the shadow of a dark cloud coming on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
and on over the sea, when they waved the signal-bush
right and left over their heads and sweeping
their feet, then they would out of harbour and
shoot the seine. John was very anxious. His lips
were moving, though he was silent. His body was
mindful of the situation, his soul was praying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That be a strange boat,&rdquo; said Penlow after a
long gossip; &ldquo;well managed, though. The man at
her wheel, whoever he be, knows the set of the tide
round here as well as he knows his cabin. I wonder
what boat that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>John had no heart to echo the wonder. Another
strange boat, doubtless, bringing more fishers. He
said it was getting tea-time, he would go along.
He knew that if the fish were found and there was
a seat in a boat it would be offered him. He
would not give his mates the pain of refusing or
of apologising. The next day he would go to St.
Ives.</p>
<p>When he reached his cottage he saw Joan and
Denas on the door-step watching the coming boat.
Their smiles and interest hurt him. He walked to
the hearth and began to fill his pipe. Then Denas,
with a large paper in her hand, came to his side.
She slipped on to his knee&ndash;&ndash;she laid her cheek
against his cheek&ndash;&ndash;she said softly, and oh, so lovingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father! father! The boat coming&ndash;&ndash;did you see
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, Denas. I saw her, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is your boat, father&ndash;&ndash;yours from masthead
to keel! All yours!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></div>
<p>He looked at her a moment and then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak them words again, Denas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke them again, smiling with frank delight
and love into his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! Now tell me about it! Joan, my
old dear, come and tell me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they sat down together and told him all,
and showed him the St. Penfer <i>News</i> containing
Lawyer Tremaine&rsquo;s statement regarding the property
which had come of right to Denas. And John
listened until the burden he had been carrying
rolled quite away from his heart, and with a great
sigh he stood up and said loudly, over and over
again, &ldquo;Thank God! Thank God! Thank God!&rdquo;
Then, as if a sudden hurry pressed him, he cried&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Come,
Joan! Come, Denas! Let us go to the pier
and welcome her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was just tacking to reach harbour when they
mingled with the crowd of men and women already
there. And Ann Trewillow was calling out: &ldquo;Why,
it is Tris Penrose at her wheel!&rdquo; Then as she came
closer a man shouted: &ldquo;It be the <i>Darling Denas</i>.
It must be John Penelles&rsquo; boat. To be sure it be
John&rsquo;s boat!&rdquo; This opinion was reached by an instant
conviction, and every face was turned to John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It be my boat, mates. Thank God and my little
girl. It be my boat, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Tris was at the slip, and the anchor
down and all the men were as eager about the new
craft as a group of horsemen could possibly be
about the points of some famous winner. Tris had
to tell every particular about her builder and her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
building, and as the fishers were talking excitedly
of these things, Joan gave a general invitation to
her friends, and they followed her to the cottage,
and heard the St. Penfer <i>News</i> read, and had a plate
of junket<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> and of clotted cream.</p>
<p>And they were really proud and glad of what they
heard. Denas had made herself so beloved that no
one had a grudging or, envious feeling. Everyone
considered how she had come back to them as if she
had been penniless; &ldquo;and teaching our little ones
too&ndash;&ndash;with sixteen hundred pounds at her back!
Wonderful! Wonderful!&rdquo; said first one and then
another of the women. Indeed, if Denas had
thought out a plan to make herself honoured and
popular, she could hardly have conceived of one more
in unison with the simple souls she had to influence.
They could not sleep for talking about it. Denas
Penelles was a veritable romance to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fair she was and fair she be!&rdquo; said Mary
Oliver, a good woman, with not a pinch of pride in
her make-up. &ldquo;And if Tris Penrose win her and
she win him, a proper wedding it will be&ndash;&ndash;a wedding
made by their guardian angel. I do think
that.&rdquo; And the group of women present answered
one and then another, &ldquo;A proper wedding it will
be, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening there was a great praise-meeting
at John&rsquo;s cottage; for in St. Penfer all rejoicing
and all sorrow ended in a religious meeting. And
Denas and Tris sang out of the same hymn-book,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
and sat side by side as they listened to John&rsquo;s
quaintly eloquent tribute to the God &ldquo;who did always
keep faith with His children.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was like to
lose sight of my God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but my God never
did lose sight of me. God&rsquo;s children be well off,
He goes so neighbourly with them. He is their
pilot and their home-bringer. I did weep to myself
all last night; but just as His promise says, joy
did come in the morning.&rdquo; And then John burst into
song, and all his mates and neighbours with him.</p>
<p>And it is in such holy, exalted atmospheres that
love reaches its sweetest, fairest strength and bloom.
Tris had no need of words. Words would have
blundered, and hampered, and darkened all he had
to say. One look at Denas as they closed the book
together&ndash;&ndash;one look as he held her hand on the door-step,
and she knew more than words could ever have
said. She saw through his eyes to the bottom of
his clear, honest soul, and she knew that he loved
her as men love who find in one woman only the
song of life, the master-key of all their being.</p>
<p>She expected Tris would come and see her the
next day, but Ann Trewillow brought word that he
had sailed with Mr. Arundel. Tris had been expecting
the order, and the yacht had only been
waiting for guests who had suddenly arrived. Denas
was rather pleased. She was not yet ready to admit
a new love. She felt that in either refusing or accepting
Tris&rsquo; affection she would be doing both
herself and Tris an injustice. A love that does not
spring into existence perfect needs cautious tending;
too much sunshine, too much care, too constant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
watching will slay it. There must be time
given for it to grow.</p>
<p>Without reasoning on the matter, Denas felt that
absence would be a good thing. She was afraid of
being driven by emotion or by circumstances into
a mistaken position. And she had now an absorbing
interest in her life. Her school was a delight. No
consideration of money qualified her pleasure in her
pupils. She was eager to teach all she knew. She
was eager to learn, that she might teach more. As
the weeks went by her school got a local fame; it
was considered a great privilege to obtain a place in it.</p>
<p>Good fortune seemed to have come to St. Penfer
by the Sea when Denas came back to it. Never
had there been a more abundant sea-harvest than
that summer. The <i>Darling Denas</i> brought luck
to the whole fleet. She was a swift sailer, always
first on the fishing-ground and always first in
harbour again; and it was a great pleasure to Denas
to watch her namesake leading out and leading
home the brown-sailed bread-winners of the hamlet.
When the time and the tide and the weather all
served, Denas might now often be seen, with her
mother and the rest of the fishermen&rsquo;s wives, standing
on the wind-blown pier watching the boats out
in the evening.</p>
<p>There had been a time when she had positively
declined the loving ceremony&ndash;&ndash;when she had hated
the thought of any community in such feelings&ndash;&ndash;when
the large brown faces of the wives and mothers
and the sad patience of their attitude had seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
her only the visible signs of a poor and sorrowful
life. And even yet, as she stood among them she
was haunted by a rhyme she had read in some picture
paper years ago&ndash;&ndash;a rhyme that so pathetically
glanced at love that dwelt between life and death
that she never could see a group of fishermen&rsquo;s wives
on the pier watching the boats outside without
saying it to herself:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<div class='poem'><div class='stanza'>
<p>&ldquo;They gazed on the boats from the pier, ah, me!</p>
<p class='indent2'>Till their sails swelled in the wind,</p>
<p>Till darkness dropped down over the sea</p>
<p class='indent2'>And their eyes with tears were blind.</p>
<p>Then home they turned, and they never spoke,</p>
<p>These daughters and wives of the fisher-folk.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>But years and experience had taught her the
falsehood of extremes; she knew now that life has
many intermediate colours between lamp-black and
rose-pink, and that if the fisherman&rsquo;s wife had
hours of anxious watching, she had also many
hours of such rapturous love as comes sparingly to
others&ndash;&ndash;love that is the portion of those who come
back from the very grave with the shadow of death
on their face.</p>
<p>In the autumn Tris returned for a few days, but
he was so busy that he could not leave the yacht.
She was being provisioned and put in order for the
long Mediterranean winter voyage, and Tris was in
constant demand. But John and Joan and Denas
walked over to St. Clair to bid him good-bye. And
never had Tris looked so handsome and so manly.
His air of authority became him. In a fishing-boat
men are equal, but on this lordly pleasure-boat it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
was very different. Tris said to one man go
and to another come, and they obeyed him with
deference and alacrity. This masterful condition
impressed Denas greatly. She thought of Tris with
a respect which promised far more than mere admiration
for his beauty or his picturesque dress.</p>
<p>After Tris was gone the winter came rapidly, but
Denas did not dread it. Neither did John nor Joan.
John looked upon his boat as a veritable godsend.
What danger could come to him on a craft so blessed?
All her takes were large and fortunate. The other
boats thought it lucky to sail in her wake. On
whatever side the <i>Darling Denas</i> cast her bait, they
knew it was right to cast on that side also.</p>
<p>Joan was happy in her husband&rsquo;s happiness; she
was happy in her unstinted housekeeping; she was
now particularly happy in Denas&rsquo; school. The little
lads and lasses brought all their news, all their
joys and sorrows to Denas; and when Denas went
home every day, Joan, with her knitting in her
hands, was waiting to give her a dainty meal and to
chat with her over all she had heard and all she had
done.</p>
<p>And Denas was happy. When she mentally contrasted
this busy, loving winter with the sorrows
of the previous one, with the hunger and cold and
poverty, the anguish of death and the loneliness, she
could not but be grateful for the little home-harbour
which her storm-tossed heart had found again.
If she had a regret, it was that she could not retain
her hold upon her finished life. Every time she
asked her heart after Roland, memory gave her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
pictures in fainter and fainter and fainter colours.
Roland was drifting farther and farther away.</p>
<p>She could no longer weep at his name. A gentle
melancholy, a half-sacred remoteness invested the
years in which he had been the light of her life.
For</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the lamp is shattered,</p>

<p>When the cloud is scattered,</p>
<p class='indent2'>The rainbow&rsquo;s glory is fled.&rdquo;</p>
</div></div>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Mercifully, youth has this marvellous elasticity.
And the children filled all the vacant places in her
life. For as yet she did not think much nor at all
decidedly about Tris. If Roland was slipping
away from memory, Tris by no means filled her
heart. Yet she was pleased when Ann Trewillow&rsquo;s
little maid Gillian told her one morning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master Arundel&rsquo;s yacht be come into harbour
safe and sound, and Captain Tris, he be brave and
hearty, and busy all to get ashore again. And my
mother do say Mr. Arundel he be going to marry
a fine lady, and great doings at the Abbey, no doubt.
And mother do say, too, that Captain Tris will be
marrying you. And I was a brave bit frightened at
that news, and I up and answered mother: &lsquo;It bean&rsquo;t
so. Miss Denas likes better teaching us boys and
girls.&rsquo; I said that, and wishing it so with all my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Denas, seeing that the boys and girls were
looking anxiously at her for an assurance of this
position, said positively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happier with you, children, than I could be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
with anyone else, and I do not intend to marry at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never? Say never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then&ndash;&ndash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet there was a faint longing in her heart for love
all her own. A man can love what others love, but
a woman wants something or someone to love that
is all her own. And she was interested enough
in Tris&rsquo; return to dress with more than usual care
that evening. She felt sure he would come, and she
put on her best black gown and did not brush the
ripples out of her front hair, but let the tiny tendrils
soften the austere gravity of her face and
make that slight shadow behind the ears which is
so womanly and becoming.</p>
<p>About seven o&rsquo;clock she heard his footsteps on the
shingle and the gay whistle to which they timed
themselves. Joan went to the door to welcome him.
Denas stood up as he entered, and then, meeting his
ardent gaze, trembled and flushed and sat down
again. He sat down beside her. He told her
how much already he had heard of her gracious work
in the village. He said it was worth going to
France and Italy and Greece, only to come back
and see how much more lovely than all other women
the Cornish women were. And by and by he took
from his pocket the most exquisite kerchief of Maltese
lace and a finely-carved set of corals. Denas
would have been less than a woman had she not
been charmed with the beautiful objects. She let
Tris knot the lovely silky lace around her throat,
and she went to her mirror and put the carved coral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
comb among her fair, abundant tresses, and the rings
in her ears, and the necklace and the locket round
her white slender throat.</p>
<p>Then Tris looked at her as if he had met a goddess
in a wilderness; and Joan, with her hands
against her sides, congratulated and praised herself
for having given to St. Penfer by the Sea a daughter
so lovely and so good.</p>

<p class='dropcap'><span class="dcap">During</span> the summer which followed, Tris
was much at home. Mr. Arundel did not go
to Norway; he was in London with the lady whom
he intended to marry, until the end of the season,
and afterward frequently at her country home in
Devonshire. Tris had then his opportunity and he
did not neglect it. But he was an impulsive young
man, and very often lost the ground on Monday
that he had gained on Sunday. All of love&rsquo;s fitful
fevers and chills tormented him, and then he tormented
Denas. He was jealous of every moment of
her time, of every kind word and look she bestowed
on others. The school offended, the children irritated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
his conception of his own rights. He was as
thoroughly unreasonable and Denas as thoroughly
contradictory as was necessary for the most tantalising
of love affairs.</p>
<p>About the beginning of the summer, just before
the pilchard season, Jacob Trenager died. He was a
Pentrath man, and of course &ldquo;went home&rdquo; for his
burying. It did not seem an event likely to affect
the lives of Tris and Denas, and yet it did have a
very pleasant influence upon their future. In some
far-back generation a Trenager had saved the life
of an Arundel, and ever since, when any adult of
one family was buried an adult of the other threw
the first earth upon the coffin, in token of their remembrance
and of their friendship. Mr. Arundel
was aware of the tradition, and he desired to perpetuate
it. He was, perhaps, actuated by some religious
respect for the customs and feelings of his ancestors;
he was, undoubtedly, considerate of the fact
that he had just bought a valuable estate in the
midst of these old clannish fisher-folk, and well aware
that such a trifling concession to their prejudices
might in a future Parliamentary struggle be of preponderating
value to him.</p>
<p>So, in accord with his expressed desire, Trenager&rsquo;s
funeral was observed with all the ancient ceremonies.
His mates from the numerous villages around
carried him all the way on his bier to Pentrath;
carried him by the sea-shore, singing hymns as they
went. A great crowd of men and women were in
the procession, and the old church at Pentrath was
full to overflowing. Jacob&rsquo;s forefathers for centuries
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
back lay in Pentrath church-yard, and there were
old people living in the town who remembered Jacob
casting the first earth on the present Mr. Arundel&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s coffin, and who wondered whether the son
would do the same kindness for the fisherman.</p>
<p>The day after Jacob&rsquo;s death it was noticed in St.
Penfer that a strange gentleman called upon Denas,
and that Denas went up the cliff-breast with him
and remained in the church town for the greater
part of the day. And for the next two days the
same thing occurred. Probably John and Joan
knew the meaning of these visits, but they said
nothing in response to the numerous &ldquo;I wonders&rdquo;
of their acquaintances. However, on the day of
the funeral the secret was made evident. The
strange gentleman was the organist of Pentrath
church, and his visit to Denas was made to induce
her to sing a portion of the funeral service; and
St. Penfer being nearer than Pentrath, they had gone
to St. Penfer church to practise.</p>
<p>Nothing, however, was said of the intention,
because Denas had not felt sure that at the last
moment she would be able to fulfil her promise.
But in the preliminary practice she quite recovered
her self-possession, and the long rest had given to
her voice a maturity of sweetness and power that
made it a delight to exercise it. She thought with
a pleasant pride of the solemn joy she was going to
give; nor was she oblivious of the fact that her
father and mother and Tris would have an opportunity

<p>It was a warm, sunshiny day. The church windows
were all open, and the rustle of the trees in
the church-yard, the hum of the bees, the songs of
the birds, the murmur of the town beyond, came
through them. Mr. Arundel stood at the foot of the
coffin, Jacob&rsquo;s family at the head; the crowd of
fishers filled the old pews and aisles to overflowing.
Suddenly there was a burst of triumphant melody.
It filled the church and lifted the souls of all present
up, and up, far beyond, and far</p>

<p>the coffin was lifted and the mourners and the singer
followed it to the open grave.</p>
<p>Never before had Denas had such joy in God&rsquo;s
pleasant gift of a melodious voice. To look at her
father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s faces was a happiness sufficient.
The adoration of Tris, the delight and gratitude
of her friends, the conviction that she had
lifted for a few moments mortal men above their mortality
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
and made them realise that they should &ldquo;yet
see God,&rdquo; was in itself a recompense beyond anything
she had ever dreamed of. Nor could she put
aside the comparisons that naturally came from this
effort of her power. To sing holily and loftily, to
sing in&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p>that had once appeared an elysium of musical ravishment
to her.</p>
<p>Tris walked home with Denas, and this evening
they came very close to each other. And then, at
the close of it, Tris unfortunately said some words
which showed how bitterly he regarded the years
that had been stolen from him by Roland Tresham.
And Denas resented the anger shown to this paling,
dying shade of her memory, and the next day Tris
went away with Mr. Arundel and did not return for
full five weeks.</p>
<p>But Mr. Arundel had been so much interested in
the singer as to ask from Tris all that he could
tell him of the life of Denas. And Tris, like all
lovers, was only too glad to talk of the girl he
adored; so as they sat together at midnight on the
lonely sea, with the full moon above them, they
grew very confidential. Tris told all the story of
his love, and Mr. Arundel told Tris about the beauty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
and accomplishments of the woman he was going to
marry; and there was, in this way, a kind of intimacy
established which resulted in a financial proposition
making the question of marriage a very easy
and happy one to Captain Tristram Penrose, of the
yacht <i>Spindrift</i>.</p>
<p>That five weeks of lonely heartache taught Denas
that Tris had become a very dear portion of her life,
and when he returned he found it more easy than
he had dared hope to induce her to bury for ever the
strange years which a strange love had somehow
slipped into her sheaf of life. And she promised
Tris to let them fall from out her grasp, all the
vain regrets, the vain hopes, the vain love which
were garnered in them.</p>
<p>Then Tris told her that he had signed a contract
with Mr. Arundel for five years, and that a portion
of this contract was the use of the stone cottage on
the hill beyond the Abbey&ndash;&ndash;the pretty home covered
with clematis and jasmine vines and surrounded
by a lovely garden. He said if Denas would share
it with him he would make it as beautiful within as
it was without, and that he would love her more
and more fondly to the last moment of his life.
He spoke with all the simple passion of his nature
and circumstances; but his heart was hot behind his
words, and Denas gave herself freely to their persuasion.</p>
<p>They were sitting on the rocks by the sea-side as
she did so; the waves were breaking at their feet;
the boats were lying on the horizon; the village
was as quiet as a painted village. She gave her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
heart and hand to Tris there; she suffered him at
last to take her to his heart and kiss her; she intoxicated
him with rapture by shyly kissing him in
return. Then they went back to the village together.
Joan was asleep in her chair. John was away with
the boats. They both kissed Joan and Tris called
her &ldquo;mother.&rdquo; And Joan said she had just been
dreaming of such a joy, and she blessed them and
then went to the door and looked toward the
<i>Darling Denas</i>. If she could only see her old dear
upon the deck, she thought she could send a thought,
a thanksgiving, that would somehow, some way,
reach him.</p>
<p>In a few days after this happy understanding,
Mr. Arundel had apparently an equally joyful surprise.
Something happened, and the days of his
waiting were over, and he was to be married immediately.
Then it was, in Cornish phrase, &ldquo;busy
all&rdquo; to get the yacht overhauled and well victualled.
For the young couple were going to spend
the winter on the Mediterranean coasts, and Tris
was as much interested in the preparations as was
possible to be, even though the unexpected change
disarranged and postponed his own plans.</p>
<p>For there had absolutely been in Tris&rsquo; mind a
resolution to marry Denas before he went on the
winter&rsquo;s cruise. Of course, in making this resolution
he had never taken into account the contrary
plans of Denas and Joan, neither of whom was disposed
to make any haste about the marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love do soon die if there be no house for him
to live in,&rdquo; said Joan; &ldquo;and I do feel to think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
that the furnishing of the house be the first thing.
And that not to be done in a week or a month, either.
Ham-sam work have no blessing or happiness with
it. To be sure not. Why would it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas held the same opinions, so Tris went away
and left the furnishing of the house to Denas and
Joan. They would have all the winter to prepare
the napery and crockery and consult about carpets
and furniture. For now that he was to become a
married man and a householder, Tris was quite inclined
to take all the domestic and social consideration
his position gave him. Mr. Arundel, in
placing such a pretty home at the service of his captain,
required by the very gift a suitable acceptance
of it.</p>
<p>And no one but a mother can tell with what delightful
pride Joan entered into this duty. She
had never bought carpets and stuffed furniture
before. The china tea-service would not let her
sleep for three nights, she was so divided between
the gold and white and the pink and gold. All the
little niceties of the dining-room and the sitting-room&ndash;&ndash;the
American kitchen utensils which to Joan
seemed marvellous and beautiful, the snowy curtains
at every window, the white-handled knives and
the plated silver&ndash;&ndash;all these things held joys and
surprises and never-ending interest to the happy
mother.</p>
<p>Between these duties and her school, the long
winter months passed happily away to Denas. The
school, indeed, troubled her in a certain way. Who
was to keep it together? John also had formed it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
into a Sunday-school and was greatly delighted with
the work. But a really good work never falls
through; there is always someone to carry it on,
and one day Denas was visited among her pupils by
the Wesleyan preacher from St. Penfer. He was
astonished at her methods and her success, and he
represented the claims of such a school with so
much force to the next district meeting that they
gladly appointed a teacher to fill the place of
Denas. It cost her a little pang to resign her authority;
but her marriage was drawing near, and it
would necessarily be followed by her removal to St.
Clair, and it was important that the children should
be provided for.</p>
<p>About the end of March she had a letter from Tris.
The yacht was then at Gibraltar on its return passage,
and Tris might be looked for within a few
days. But the house was nearly ready and all her
personal preparations were made. Such as pertained
to the ceremony and their future life they would
make together when Tris returned home. Never
had father, and mother, and daughter, been so
happy and so closely one. Joan had grown young
again. John sang from morning to night. Denas
had the loveliness of love transfiguring the loveliness
of mere physical beauty. It was busy all and
happy all within the Penelles&rsquo; cottage during those
days of expectation.</p>
<p>One morning Joan was going through the whole
house before the grand final preparations, and for
some reason she opened a closet usually little regarded&ndash;&ndash;a
closet full of those odds and ends families
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
do not like to destroy. The first thing she lifted
was that picture of Denas as &ldquo;Mademoiselle Denasia
in Pinafore.&rdquo; It had been her pride and comfort in
sorrowful days now overpast, and she laid it upon
the table and stood looking at it. Denas entered
the room while this act of tender reminiscence was
going on. She did not at first perceive or understand
the object of it. But when she reached her
mother&rsquo;s side and saw the yellow, faded presentment,
her face flushed crimson, and with flashing
eyes she covered the picture with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you keep it? Oh, mother, how could
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, then, Denas, &rsquo;twas my only comfort many
a day and many a time. Don&rsquo;t take it away&ndash;&ndash;Denas!
Denas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not have it in the house&ndash;&ndash;&rsquo;tis a shame to
me; it breaks my heart; how could you, mother?&rdquo;
and she drew the paper away, and walking to the
fire, threw it upon the coals. It burned slowly,
browning gradually from the dancing feet to the tips
of the fingers meeting above the head.</p>
<p>With a white, sad face she watched it burn to a
brown film that the upward draught of the chimney
carried out of her sight. Joan also watched the immolation,
and she was a little angry at it. That
picture of Mademoiselle Denasia was one of Joan&rsquo;s
secret idols. No one likes to watch the destruction
of their idols, and Joan was hardly pacified by the
kisses and loving words with which Denas extenuated
her act. For an hour or two she had an air of
injury. She had been in the habit of showing this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
picture with an air of serious secrecy and with
many sighs to any new acquaintance or strange visitor,
and its destruction really put a stop to this
clandestine bit of egotism; for who would believe
such an improbable story without the pictured Denasia
to prove it?</p>
<p>Denas regarded the incident as a happy omen.
As she watched the picture turn to cinder, she
buried fathoms deep below the tide of her present
life all the restless, profitless, half-regretful memories
it represented. A word or two said by the
preacher the day he visited her school had clung to
her consciousness as a burr clings to wool. They
were speaking of the education necessary for the
class of children gathered there, and Denas, after
naming the studies pursued, said: &ldquo;They are sufficient
for the life before them;&rdquo; then, with an involuntary
sigh, she added, &ldquo;It is a very narrow
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And perhaps the minister had heard something of
her story, for he answered gravely: &ldquo;God knows
just where He wants every soul. That is the life,
that is the school, for that soul, and no life is too
narrow. The humblest will afford</p>

<p>Mrs. Tresham, that is the grand lesson we are sent
here to learn; self-denial, as against self-pleasing
and self-assertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denas only said, &ldquo;Yes, sir;&rdquo; but she took the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
words into her heart and found herself repeating
them a hundred times a day.</p>
<p>Tris came home just before Easter. The spring
was in his heart, the spring was in his life and love.
The winds, the young trees, the peeping crocus-buds,
were part and parcel of Denas and of his hopes
in her. What charming walks they took to their
home! What suggestions and improvements and alterations
they made! No two young thrushes, building
their first nest, could have been more interested
and more important. Mr. and Mrs. Arundel had
remained in town for the Easter holidays, and Tris
was very nearly lord of all his time. He rather
thought Mr. Arundel had purposely left him so at
this happy epoch, and the idea gave him the more
pleasure in his light duties.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of good-natured discussion
about the proper date for this wonderful wedding.
Tris acted as if it was the first wedding in the world.
He was sure everyone in St. Penfer and St. Clair
would be disappointed beyond comfort unless they
had a chance to be present. He thought, therefore,
that Easter Sunday would be the day of days in
this respect. All the boats would be in harbour.
All the women and children would have their new
gowns and bonnets on. There would be a special
service in the chapel&ndash;&ndash;and then, finally:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house be ready, mother, and I be ready,
and Denas be ready, and what are we waiting for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as John, and Joan, and Tris were of one
mind, what could Denas do but be of the same
mind? After all, the great anxiety was the weather.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
The restless way in which Tris queried of the winds
and watched the clouds almost made John angry.
&ldquo;You do be enough to beckon a storm, Tris,&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Let be! Let be!&rdquo; Yet for all that John
himself walked oftener to his door than was his custom,
and looked seaward and windward in a furtive
kind of way, very amusing to the women, who saw
clearly through his anxiety.</p>
<p>But even the weather sometimes comes up to our
hopes and is even better than our expectations.
Easter Sunday broke in a royal mood of sunshine.
There was not a breath of wind; the sea was like a
sea of sapphire sprinked with incalculable diamonds;
the boats lay lazily swinging on the tide-top;
the undercliff was in its Easter green and white.
The lark set the bride-song going, and so woke up
the thrush, and the thrush called to the blackbird,
and the woods soon rang with music.</p>
<p>The ceremony was to be in the St. Clair chapel,
and at nine o&rsquo;clock Tris came in the yacht&rsquo;s boat
for his bride and her parents. The boat had been
freshly painted white. The four sailors who were
to row her were in snow-white duck and blue caps
and kerchiefs. Tris had on his best uniform&ndash;&ndash;blue
broadcloth and gilt buttons. Tris was handsome
enough and proud and happy enough to have set
off a fisher&rsquo;s suit of blue flannel; but he trod like a
prince and looked like a young sea-god in his splendid
array.</p>
<p>It had been thought best for the bride to go to St.
Clair by sea. There was no carriage available,
and the walk to St. Clair was long and apt to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
wet <a name='TC_10'></a><ins title="Was 'fom'">from</ins> the last tide. And nobody wanted the
bride-dress to be soiled. Besides which, the sea-way
gave the St. Penfer people an opportunity to
set her off with waving kerchiefs and a thousand
good wishes; and it also gave the people of St.
Clair an opportunity to welcome her in the same
manner. Those who did not know about such things
and who were wickedly reckless concerning signs
and omens&ndash;&ndash;which sailor and fisher folk never
are&ndash;&ndash;said this seaward road to the church might
have been avoided and the bride&rsquo;s gown kept
sweetly fresh and unruffled by Denas simply dressing
in her own house. But Denas knew well that it
was unlucky; for the bride in her bride-dress must
go into her house before she comes out of it.</p>
<p>The chapel was crowded up to the pulpit steps,
all but John&rsquo;s pew, which was empty until the
bride&rsquo;s party took possession of it. It was a sight
to make men and women happy only to look at
Joan Penelles&rsquo; face. John tried to preserve a grave
look, but Joan beamed upon every man and woman
present. When the little stir of their entrance had
subsided, then the Easter service went joyously on.
It was known that the wedding was to be solemnized
between the sermon and the benediction, and
though the sermon was a very good one, all thought
it a little long that morning. For there is something
about a bridal, and a bride, and a bridegroom,
that is perennially fresh and young.</p>
<p>But at length the happy moment arrived. Tris
rose and offered his hand to Denas. Then Denas
also rose and let her long cloak fall down, and put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
her bonnet off her head, and walked by Tris&rsquo; side
to the communion table. John and Joan proudly
followed. All with curious interest watched the
bride, for few then present had ever seen a bride so
bride-like. And well might the handsome sailor
be proud of her as she stood beside him robed in
white, lustrous silk, with lilies at her breast and the
gleam of scarlet corals in her fair hair and at her
white throat.</p>
<p>Let those who have been so blessed as to live
through such moments imagine them. And, alas!
for those who cannot say with a smile, &ldquo;I know;
I know.&rdquo; In this marriage, the bride and bridegroom&rsquo;s
joy was doubled by being so enthusiastically
shared. It was not only the preacher who
gave them the benediction; they walked through an
atmosphere so full of kindness and good-will and
good wishes that they could do nothing at all but
smile, and smile, and smile again to the &ldquo;God
bless you, dears,&rdquo; which greeted them at every step.</p>
<p>Then the clerk spread open the book and the
preacher put the pen into the bride&rsquo;s hand. She
looked at her husband; she looked at her mother;
she hesitated a moment, and then wrote boldly&ndash;&ndash;not
Denasia&ndash;&ndash;but&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Denas.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither father nor mother disputed the name.
They certified it with their own names, and then
passed with their children into the sunshine. The
congregation were waiting outside. They parted
and made a way between them for the bride and the
bridegroom to take; and so standing there, watched
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
them go hand-in-hand up the hillside to the pretty
vine-covered house which was to be their future
home. To mortal eyes they seemed to walk alone,
but they did not. They had right welcome company,

<p>The effect of this Cornish sentiment upon the Cornish heart
is mighty, as it is past reasoning about. A Cornish friend of
mine was in a silver mine among the Andes, and looking at
the big, bearded men around, he suddenly called out &ldquo;<span class='smcap'>One</span> and
<span class='smcap'>All</span>!&rdquo; In an instant four of the men had dropped their tools
and were holding his hands in as brotherly fashion as if the tie
of blood was between them. It is, indeed, one of those shibboleths
of race which move the soul to its most ancient depths.
The malign influences which destroy even the domestic affections
touch not the deeper sense of race. Age only increases its intensity,
and being a purely unselfish love, we may believe that it
survives death and claims the heritage of eternity.</p>
